# Nanocodex for macOS

A SwiftUI and AppKit application for Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 14 or later.
This is the single native Mac app: its tiled workspace, agent activity menu bar,
and automatic background Hand share one app model and runtime. The
[`apple/`](../apple/README.md) app targets iPhone and iPad.
The interface uses native windows, menus, text editing, folder pickers, keyboard
shortcuts, and Keychain. It does not embed an Electron window or webview.

The managed-agent and Hand implementation comes from the explicit shared package
`js/desktop-runtime`. A private bundled Node executable hosts that package over a
small JSONL protocol. A built app needs no separate Node installation.

The local `apple/NanocodexUI` package owns the shared chat palette, Markdown
block rendering, and copy feedback. Both Apple apps render headings, lists,
links, quotes, tables, and code using Foundation’s Markdown parser. Copy
controls work on complete responses and individual code blocks. Desktop pane
arrangement, tiling, navigation shortcuts, and per-agent state remain owned by
the existing workspace.

Open **Workspace and account → Scheduled jobs** to view jobs across the account.
Select a job to edit its prompt, timing, active status, or conversation mode, or
cancel future scheduling. Dispatched and running work is not stopped by
cancellation. New schedules are created by asking an agent in chat.

## Meetings

Open **Meetings** in the workspace toolbar/sidebar or press **⌘⇧M** to review
account-synced iPhone recordings. Notes and generated summaries are separate;
the Transcript tab preserves the complete saved text and marks partial captures.
No audio is stored and playback is unavailable. Save notes to sync them across
devices. Unsaved notes remain in memory when switching recordings, workspace
pages, or hiding the window; switching accounts clears private account data.
The visible, active library refreshes on return without background polling.

Summary failures leave the recording intact and expose **Retry summary**.
Long recordings use bounded full-source summary chunks rather than silently
truncating the transcript; service limits are reported explicitly. Ready summaries
are immutable per saved revision; **Refresh enhanced notes**
reads the current receipt without another generation.
Delete removes the transcript, notes, and summary after confirmation.

The native user journey uses actual ManagedClient HTTP requests through a
Debug-only, loopback-pinned adapter to the production account router/D1 fixture.
With normal build prerequisites prepared, run these in two shells from the root:

```sh
node js/managed/scripts/meeting-library-fixture.mjs --port 8797 --persist output/meeting-library-fixture-state
scripts/xcodebuild-guard.sh -project macos/Nanocodex.xcodeproj -scheme Nanocodex \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath output/meetings-macos \
  -resultBundlePath output/meetings-macos-ui.xcresult \
  -only-testing:NanocodexUITests/NanocodexUITests/testSyncedMeetingsNotesSummaryDraftAndDeletion test
```

The journey creates synthetic UUID-scoped recordings, verifies server-side note
revision updates and exact lost-response retry, exercises unavailable-summary
recovery and full-source long/notes-only summaries, preserves drafts across
navigation and cloud conflicts, renders partial transcripts, and deletes via
native controls. Screenshots live in the result bundle. It requires the local fixture;
no live account is used. The fixture control temporarily toggles provider failure,
so do not run another summary journey concurrently on the same fixture port.

## Build and open

Install workspace dependencies with `pnpm install` and prepare the pinned Node
binary once using [the bundled-runtime instructions](Resources/runtime/README.md).
Then, from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm build:macos
open macos/build/Build/Products/Release/Nanocodex.app
```

The Xcode project is `macos/Nanocodex.xcodeproj`, with the shared `Nanocodex`
scheme. Xcode copies the built shared helper, Node, its license, and the original
Nanocodex icon into the application. Bundle identity is
`xyz.paradigm.nanocodex.macos`; its display name, menu, icon, About panel, and
window title are **Nanocodex**. Local builds use ad hoc signing. Distribution
signing and notarization require the distributor's Apple Developer identity.
The bundled `nanocodex2` helper uses the nightly CLI's hypervisor signing policy
so it is ready to host VMs without a runtime copy and re-sign. Its firmware
loader uses `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`; the helper is signed separately from the
hardened app, with the same entitlements as the standalone CLI.

For development with the repository's `.env`:

```sh
pnpm --filter @nanocodex/desktop-runtime build
scripts/xcodebuild-guard.sh -project macos/Nanocodex.xcodeproj -scheme Nanocodex -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath macos/build build
open macos/build/Build/Products/Debug/Nanocodex.app
```

Debug builds find the repository `.env` automatically. Release builds accept an
explicit `NANOCODEX_ENV_FILE`, `NC_API_KEY`, or `NANOCODEX_API_KEY` at launch, or
phone sign-in. The first launch asks for a phone number and a six-digit SMS code;
it stores the resulting account securely in macOS Keychain. Settings offers
**Switch Account**, and **Advanced** in the sign-in form accepts an API key.
A successfully imported development account is
stored in macOS Keychain so later Finder/Dock launches reconnect automatically.
API keys are never stored in desktop preferences, displayed in the transcript,
or sent to native Hand subprocesses.

## Background Hands

The shared native Hand connects independently of optional OpenAI CUA downloads.
Missing managed components install in the background; native screen controls
remain subject to macOS Screen Recording and Accessibility permission. Because a
Hand publishes its tool catalog at attachment startup, newly installed upstream
CUA tools appear on the next attachment or service start. A failed automatic CUA
provider does not prevent shell access; initialization of an installed automatic
provider is limited to 500 milliseconds before falling back to native controls. An
explicitly selected custom provider still reports its configuration errors.

The installer prepares the current-user LaunchAgent before sign-in. It stays
dormant until `nanocodex account login` or `nanocodex2 login` succeeds, then connects
automatically using the exact saved account file and origin. Repeating the same
login preserves a connected service; changed credentials reconnect it. A failed
login leaves the installed service ready for the next attempt. An existing service
configured for another account file or origin retains its owner.

The Mac app bundles both the Hand and its matching installer and prepares the
service on first launch. On app sign-in, the runtime
verifies its Keychain credential through the native CLI over stdin and saves it
in an account-specific private file under its runtime `hand-accounts` directory.
The new LaunchAgent uses that file; the global CLI login and existing service
configuration remain unchanged. Keys and API responses are never printed by the
bridge. A terminal-only environment credential still needs a saved login before
automatic service enrollment.

The signed app installed in `/Applications` enables **Open Nanocodex at login**
on its first normal launch. macOS starts it after you sign into the computer;
the saved account, laptop Hand, and automatic screen sharing then reconnect.
Settings shows the actual login-item status and links to macOS Login Items when
approval is required. Explicit app or system opt-outs are preserved. Tests,
isolated development sessions, and builds outside `/Applications` never register
a login item.

The **Screens** button beside the tabs (or **Hands → Remote Screens**) opens the
shared native viewer as a resizable pane beside the conversation. The split
divider adjusts the workspace and screen widths. Agent tabs, history, and the
composer remain usable while viewing, and switching tabs retains the screen.
The pane's **×** closes the viewer. Mac/iPhone publishing controls are under
**Share a screen**, and app-owned sharing continues when the viewer closes. Desktop-enabled
factory VMs appear automatically once their publisher connects. The same screens
are available from the iPhone/iPad inbox and conversations. Mac screen sharing
starts automatically after sign-in when Screen Recording permission is available,
and remains owned by the app when its windows close. It remembers the selected
display and restores capture after system interruptions or display changes.
The Mac's screen identity is saved across reopening the picker and restarting
the app. Shell-only VM images do not publish a desktop; Cloudflare
sandbox desktops require the managed desktop feature flag. A disconnected viewer retries with the current publication generation,
retains the selected screen, and offers **Reconnect** after a 90-second recovery
window. Control must be acquired again after reconnecting.
Mac publishing also reconnects after temporary signaling outages while keeping
the selected display. **Stop sharing** disables automatic screen sharing across
relaunches. Re-enable **Share this Mac’s screen automatically** in Settings;
screen and control permission setup is available there and in Remote Screens.
Quitting ends sharing while preserving the preference for the next launch.

The Hands page, chat picker, and menu bar include devices connected elsewhere on
the same account. Previously observed devices remain listed as offline after
disconnecting. This requires the managed `/v1/account/hands` endpoint and its
account Worker route. Only this Mac's local Hands have start/stop controls.
iPhone availability remains limited by iOS background execution; retaining its
row does not wake the phone or keep its socket connected indefinitely.

The compact Nanocodex icon in the macOS menu bar stays available after closing
the window. It changes to a waveform while agents work; its tooltip and accessible
label report connection, Hand, and running-agent counts. Its fixed square width
avoids the expanding text label competing for space with other menu extras. Click it for the agent control panel: live
counts, open agents with running/queued/review status, and Hands with active call
counts and Connect/Stop controls. Running agents appear first; click an agent to
open it, or stop its current turn in place. The agent counts cover the workspace's
open agents. **Agent → Agent Control Panel** (`⌘⇧P`) opens the same panel.
**Open Nanocodex** or clicking the Dock icon restores the workspace; **Manage**
opens the full Hands page. Closing or minimizing the window keeps
the app and its Hands running. **Quit Nanocodex** (`⌘Q`) stops the local runtime
and its Hands.

**Make this Mac available as a Hand** in Settings and the control panel is on
by default. Turning it off, stopping the automatic device Hand, or removing it
persists an opt-out across reconnects, relaunches, and account switches. Starting
that Hand or turning the setting back on re-enables it. Ordinary window close
and app shutdown preserve the preference; private workspace grants and drafts
remain account-scoped.

**Keep Mac awake while Hands are running**, in the menu bar and Settings, is
on by default and saved on this Mac; an existing explicit choice is preserved. When enabled, a connecting or connected
Hand prevents idle system sleep even with no windows open. Stopping all Hands,
signing out, a runtime failure, or quitting releases the activity. The display
can still turn off. Closing the lid, choosing Sleep, or low battery can still
suspend the Mac; this option does not run Hands through forced sleep or after
quitting. Keeping the Mac awake uses more battery.

**Screens** (`⌘⌥S`, or `s` after Escape) stays beside the conversation while
switching tabs. Search the screen list or use the selected screen's title menu
to switch devices. Viewing and control are shown separately; click the screen
after **Take control** to type, and use `⌘⇧Esc` to release. Remote keyboard
shortcuts, including browser zoom, belong to the remote screen while it has
keyboard focus. The keyboard button exposes text entry and special keys.
Disconnected screens show a reconnect action directly over the preview.

## Browser tabs and agent panes

The desktop supports horizontal browser tabs and a resizable native sidebar.
Use the sidebar button in the window toolbar, or Settings → Appearance → Tab
layout, to switch. The preference persists; switching retains drafts, selections,
split panes, and the screen viewer. Each tab holds one agent or a saved split
layout. The native window toolbar contains Back/Forward, Search, New
Conversation, Tab Overview, arrangement actions, and the screen-pane toggle.
The **…** menu opens Hands, Connections, keyboard help, and Settings. Window
controls keep their standard macOS size when you zoom the workspace.
On macOS 26, native toolbar groups, selected horizontal tabs, screen controls,
and the Send action use Apple's Liquid Glass. Conversation filters live in the
arrangement menu; there is no extra filter strip above the conversation.
Settings navigation uses a system segmented control; Settings and Hands use grouped forms.
Docking previews, tab changes, and layout transitions honor Reduce Motion. Older macOS versions use native material; Reduce Transparency uses
opaque controls and Reduce Motion disables layout/preview motion. Chat content
keeps an opaque, readable surface.

**Split Right** (`⌘\`) and **Split Below** (`⌘⌥J`) divide the active agent's pane
and create another agent. **Open beside** (`⌘⇧\`) brings an existing open agent
into the layout. Splits can be nested in either direction without a fixed pane or nesting cap.
Use the **Layout** menu for splits, opening an existing agent beside the current
one, focus, renaming, and review actions. Single conversations omit the duplicate
pane header; split layouts retain handles, titles, and per-pane controls.
Drag a pane's six-dot handle to any edge
of another pane. The highlighted half previews the destination; dropping in the
center swaps the agents. Drop a handle onto the top tab strip to make a separate
tab. Agents, drafts, queues, editors, and reading positions keep their identities.
Drag the gap between panes to resize; it snaps near quarter, half, and
three-quarter proportions. Double-click to balance the split. Resize handles
also expose accessibility increment/decrement actions. Editors and viewports
retain their identity throughout resizing. Small windows scroll the layout when
its panes cannot fit at a usable minimum size.

- Top tabs switch between saved layouts and remember the last focused pane.
  Drag a tab to reorder the entire group. `⌘⇧[` / `⌘⇧]` cycles browser tabs.
- Back / Forward (`⌘[` / `⌘]`) revisits selected conversations, restoring their
  split group and focused pane without changing drafts or review state. Closed
  tabs are skipped. The tab-count button (`⌘⇧O`) opens a searchable overview of
  open conversations, split groups, status, and drafts; Return opens the first
  match. Durable history remains available through `⌘K`.
- `⌘T` / `⌘N` creates a separate conversation. `⌘W` or the tab's **×** closes
  that browser tab; `⌘⇧T` restores its agents, drafts, and split arrangement.
  Closing a view does not delete durable conversation history or stop its tasks.
- A pane's **×** removes it from the layout and keeps its agent in a separate tab.
  **Focus this agent** temporarily expands it; **Resume layout** restores panes.
  Each pane's menu offers splitting, renaming, moving, and closing that agent.
- `⌘⌥←` / `⌘⌥→` navigates panes. Escape enters navigation; Tab and arrows move
  between agents; Enter returns to the active composer without sending.
  While writing, arrows edit text normally. `⌘⌥⇧←` / `⌘⌥⇧→` reorders panes.
- After Escape, `v` / `%` splits right and `h` / `"` splits below. `Ctrl H/J/K/L`
  selects a pane by direction; `Shift H/J/K/L` resizes its divider, and
  `Ctrl Shift H/J/K/L` resizes while writing. `z` focuses/restores the layout,
  `x` closes the pane, and `{` / `}` moves it. `?` opens the shortcut reference,
  also available in the Workspace menu. Unmodified letters remain ordinary text
  in the composer.
- **Inbox / Running / All** keeps the single-agent review flow. Swipe through
  agents with AppKit's native page transitions and retained editor/scroll cache.
  Live output never reorders conversations. **Seen** (`⌘D`) records an update;
  **Later** (`⌘⇧D`) defers it. Neither navigation nor tiling marks an agent seen.
- `⌘K` searches durable conversations; Up/Down chooses and Return opens a result.
  Drafts, model controls, Hands, voice sessions, and sending belong to their agent.
  Voice continues on its originating agent while changing layouts.
- Layout trees, split proportions, pane focus, drafts, model settings, review
  cursors, and queued messages use the existing account-scoped preferences.
  Previous sidebar and horizontal layouts migrate without losing agents or drafts.

The hosted native tests cover mixed splits, resizing with retained editors,
layout switching, group reordering/closing/reopening, persistence, keyboard
navigation, queue ownership, and review behavior.

## Compute and conversation controls

- **Voice** (the waveform beside Send) opens the same native WebRTC conversation
  used by the iPhone app. It stays attached to the originating agent when you
  switch panes. A central spinner stays visible until the call is ready, then
  becomes a violet and copper contour orb. Both speakers' transcripts stream directly
  into chat; saved history replaces matching live speech without changing the
  composer. End voice with the dark X button. Closing its tab, changing accounts, and
  quitting stop capture. Microphone permission is requested only when starting.
- Return sends; Shift Return inserts a newline. While an agent is running,
  send queues a durable follow-up above the composer, as in iOS Inbox.
  **Steer now** stops that message's captured predecessor; it never sends the
  follow-up twice. Queue rows support cancellation and retain unconfirmed
  messages for retry with the same ID and exact payload. They survive navigation
  and relaunch in account-scoped storage. Stop / `⌘.` stops the current running
  turn without cancelling the waiting follow-ups. Cancelling a waiting message
  removes it quietly, including the service’s cancellation-draining events;
  it cannot move the viewport or clear a completed answer’s Inbox attention.
- New prompts sit at the top and replies grow downward. Streaming never jumps
  to the bottom; **Latest** is an explicit jump. Each turn retains its message
  identities even when another message is accepted during its response.
- Thinking, tools, progress commentary, and subagent updates coalesce into one
  compact **Activity** row per response. Open it for a bounded timeline, then
  open a step for its full details. Final answers and errors stay visible. Step
  counts and a live status update without growing the closed transcript; issue
  counts remain visible. Each pane retains its own disclosure choices.
- Model, effort, Pro reasoning, and fast mode are available in the
  composer. Model and Pro are fixed after the first accepted turn; effort and
  Fast mode can still change.
- Signing in automatically connects this Mac as an account-wide Hand and creates
  `~/Nanocodex` if needed. Relaunch reuses and reconnects the same Hand; temporary
  connection failures retry automatically. **Stop** disables the automatic Hand
  until explicitly re-enabled, including across relaunches.
  Choosing a
  folder for a tab and then sending automatically prepares a Hand scoped to that
  thread. Merely choosing a folder does not start compute.
- Native Hands run commands with the macOS user's permissions. Their processes
  use a filtered environment. Closing a window keeps Nanocodex and its Hands
  running; quitting disconnects the Hands and stops owned processes.
- VM Hands use the existing nanocodex2 VM lifecycle, with discovered defaults
  when available. Advanced controls select an existing VM image/runtime and
  CPU/memory/network settings. A Cloud Hand is created through the agent's real
  `mount` tool.
- Another Mac connects by opening Nanocodex with the same account.
  Advanced server instructions use the documented nanocodex2 VM
  command. Account connections, provider access, MCP, and SSH are managed through
  the existing account page.

## Verification

The UI-test target has a Debug-only fixture that exercises the real window
toolbar without starting account services.

Native screenshots are under `macos/build/evidence`, including
`native-inbox-default.png`, `native-inbox-tiles-light.png`, `native-inbox-tiles-narrow.png`,
`native-inbox-focus.png`, and `native-inbox-zero.png`. The hosted UI fixtures do
not contact a service. The real service journey requires the development `.env`
and uses isolated preferences and its own managed thread.

The isolated native rendering benchmark captures before/after chat, Hands,
Settings, and narrow-window screenshots, plus editor and tab timings in
`native-performance-before.json` and `native-performance-after.json`. It measures
actual AppKit editing and SwiftUI layout in a Debug test host, not process launch
or network latency. Draft serialization is deferred until the save debounce expires. Streaming preserves
the reading position; a **Latest** button jumps down explicitly. Queued messages
are persisted before network submission, independently of the draft debounce.

JSONL framing and decoding now run on a serial background queue with ordered
main-actor delivery. Unchanged account snapshots do not republish UI state, and
unchanged turns retain their projected messages. Corrected events, replay,
history prepends and account resets retain the canonical reducer's behavior.

Earlier messages load automatically when a user scrolls within 240 points of
the transcript's top. Initial layout and streamed output never fetch pages.
Only one page loads at a time, and native message geometry preserves the visible
row across prepends even when the current response grows below it. The hosted
AppKit history journey checks short pages, scrolling during a pending request,
frame-by-frame position retention, exhaustion, and retry after leaving and
returning to the boundary; `native-automatic-history.png` records that viewport.

Generated code-mode output is rendered inline outside Activity, using the shared
`NanocodexUI` media renderer. Both raw and structured tool results are projected:
emitted text, images, audio, video, and file links remain visible, while embedded
binary data is removed from diagnostics. Stable content identities deduplicate
nested tool results and their outer exec copies. Parsed output is retained per
result while the same turn streams. The protocol and hosted-window fixtures
exercise the actual JSON-string `input_text`/`input_image` shape plus MCP images
and structured file links; `native-generated-code-output.png` records the visible
result without network use.

```sh
xcodebuild -project macos/Nanocodex.xcodeproj -scheme Nanocodex -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath macos/build -only-testing:NanocodexTests -parallel-testing-enabled NO test
```

`ProtocolTests` separately cover durable event replay, tool-result projection,
Astra settings, and compatibility with the shared state/tab contract. To run only those tests,
use `-only-testing:NanocodexTests/ProtocolTests`.

`VoiceTests` covers conversation ownership and saved voice transcript projection.
Its opt-in native speech journey feeds recorded speech through an installed
BlackHole 2ch input into the actual Swift/WebRTC session and managed OpenAI backend.
It interrupts spoken counting, asks a replacement question and a follow-up, and
stops during output. It restores the original input device and deletes its agent.
Prepare its synthetic clips and run it explicitly:

```sh
say -v Samantha -r 175 -o /tmp/nanocodex-voice-count.wav --file-format=WAVE --data-format=LEI16@24000 'Please count slowly from one to thirty, with a short pause between each number.'
say -v Daniel -r 185 -o /tmp/nanocodex-native-voice-interrupt.wav --file-format=WAVE --data-format=LEI16@24000 'Stop counting. What is six plus seven? Just say the answer.'
say -v Samantha -r 185 -o /tmp/nanocodex-native-voice-followup.wav --file-format=WAVE --data-format=LEI16@24000 'What color is a clear daytime sky? Just say the color.'
TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DESKTOP_VOICE_LIVE=1 TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_VOICE_SOX="$(command -v sox)" xcodebuild -project macos/Nanocodex.xcodeproj -scheme Nanocodex -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath macos/build -only-testing:NanocodexTests/VoiceTests -parallel-testing-enabled NO test
```

For a signed-in subscription account, set
`TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DESKTOP_VOICE_KEYCHAIN=1` to use the app's existing
Keychain credential instead of the development environment. Sign the test host
with the same development identity as the installed app to preserve its
Keychain access; isolated test preferences remain separate.

`NANOCODEX_VOICE_TIMING=1` enables timestamped stage and transport diagnostics
in Debug or Release. The bounded log is `Documents/voice-timing.log` in the app
container, or the explicit `NANOCODEX_VOICE_TIMING_LOG` path. It records HTTP
status/timing, transcript event types, delegation, model-event delivery, playback
enablement and audio energy; it does not record speech, credentials, or SDP.
The speech test retains milestone and audio-state evidence even when a call fails.

`testNativeVoiceStartStopRestart` with
`TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DESKTOP_VOICE_RESTART_LIVE=1` uses the existing Keychain
account for three same-agent starts/stops, with BlackHole input and no speech
fixture. It restores the input device, deletes its disposable agent, and records
startup/cleanup timings in `native-voice-restarts.json`.

`testNativeGreetingAndPersonalMemory` separately checks a brief greeting followed
by an unknown personal fact. Enable it with
`TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DESKTOP_MEMORY_VOICE_LIVE=1`, the same account/SoX flags,
and an explicit timing-log path. Prepare the fixed synthetic fixtures first:

```sh
say -v Samantha -r 175 -o /tmp/nanocodex-native-voice-greeting.wav --file-format=WAVE --data-format=LEI16@24000 'Hi, say hello briefly.'
say -v Samantha -r 175 -o /tmp/nanocodex-native-voice-personal.wav --file-format=WAVE --data-format=LEI16@24000 "What secret passphrase did I choose for the fictional Project Cedar Comet? Check my stored memory. If you cannot find it, tell me you don't know."
```

This journey requires a new managed delegation for the personal question and an
explicit unknown answer. It writes `native-memory-voice-live.json`, including
voice settings and timestamps, restores the original audio input, and removes
its test agent. Run acoustic phone tests separately to avoid mixing their input
with the Mac's audible output.

Before deleting a failed memory-test agent, the fixture saves
`native-memory-voice-failure-state.json`: durable cursors, event types/timestamps,
active turn IDs, and turn status. It excludes message/tool payloads and credentials.
To inspect a retained owned test agent without starting voice or sending a turn,
run `testNativeOwnedAgentDiagnostics` with
`TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DIAGNOSTIC_AGENT_TITLE` set to its exact unique title (or
`TEST_RUNNER_NANOCODEX_DIAGNOSTIC_AGENT_ID` for a known owned test-agent ID). This
read-only test uses the existing Keychain account and saves the same metadata file.

Voice evidence is saved in `macos/build/evidence/native-voice-live.json` and
`native-voice-live.png`. These timings include the real provider and local audio
device; a cold connection still takes seconds. They do not measure an iPhone's
physical microphone, Bluetooth route, or cellular network.

`NanocodexUITests` additionally uses macOS UI automation for keyboard/menu and
navigation checks. It requires a Mac with Xcode UI automation enabled; the
current development machine rejected that runner with **“Timed out while
enabling automation mode.”** Hosted native tests do not require changing that
machine-wide setting.

Use `NANOCODEX_DESKTOP_DATA` for isolated development sessions. Such sessions
never read, write, or delete the normal account's Keychain entry. Normal
preferences live in `~/Library/Application Support/Nanocodex/Native`, and are
scoped to the connected account.

### Workspace keyboard and zoom

Press **Esc** to navigate and **Enter** to write. In navigation mode, **v**
splits right, **h** splits below, arrows select spatial neighbors, Tab/Shift-Tab
cycle panes, **z** focuses the selected pane or restores its layout, and **{ / }**
swap panes. **x** closes the selected pane; Command-Shift-T reopens it with its
draft. **Ctrl-H/J/K/L** selects left/down/up/right even from a composer;
**Shift-H/J/K/L** moves the nearest matching divider, with Ctrl added while
writing. **?** opens the shortcut reference. Unmodified letters stay text while
writing. Splits opened with v/h stay in navigation mode, allowing repeated splits.

**Command-plus/minus** zooms the workspace from 75–150%; **Command-0** restores
actual size. Zoom persists locally and preserves native editors and drafts.
Pane focus (z) is separate from display zoom. Dock previews belong to one active
drag and clear on cancellation, drop, Escape, and window/application deactivation.
The composer keeps an opaque writing surface and native macOS 26 glass actions,
with bordered actions for Reduce Transparency. Voice settings use a grouped, scrollable form with a bounded
speaking-style editor, so labels and actions remain visible.

### Keeping the UI responsive

The runtime's serial decode worker prepares transcript rows, tool-output media,
voice transcript expansion, activity labels, review status, and queue-reconciliation
facts before delivering snapshots to the main actor. Exact event revisions reuse
prepared data; replay, history prepends, and corrections still pass through the
canonical reducer. Per-thread reducer retention is bounded to 24 threads and
clears across account scopes. Typed RPC response decoding also runs on this worker.

A separate serial writer encodes RPC frames and writes stdin, so pipe backpressure
cannot block input or rendering. Closing stdin stays ordered behind the last save.
Layout encoding runs off the main actor with cancellation checks before submitting
debounced saves. Save acknowledgements cannot overwrite the live layout or trigger
another workspace-wide update. Transcript views compare their actual render inputs,
so composer changes and updates in other panes do not rebuild their view trees.

Shared Markdown parsing uses a background actor and bounded cache, coalescing
streaming updates for 32 ms. Only current, uncancelled parses publish blocks.
AppKit, SwiftUI rendering, input routing, and observable state commits remain on
macOS's main actor.
