# Connect modal browser journey

Run from the repository root after installing dependencies and Playwright Chromium:

```sh
pnpm --filter nanocodex-connect-protocol run build
pnpm --filter nanocodex-connect-ui run build
pnpm --filter @nanocodex/connect-dialog run test:browser
```

The Vite fixture imports the built public `ConnectOnboarding` component and the shared stylesheet. It uses a synthetic request and host response callback. Only the account/SMS and external provider service transport is replaced by local HTTP endpoints; no SMS, account creation, or external authorization occurs. The `modal.nanocodex.localhost` hostname exercises the managed SMS flow instead of the loopback-only WebAuthn path. Playwright supplies its host resolution rule.

The journeys cover invalid phone input, a delivery failure and recovery, malformed and rejected codes, successful sign-in, explicit consent, consent cancellation, initial cancellation, and Escape. Light/dark desktop, mobile, short, and 320×360 keyboard-sized viewports assert edge-to-edge full-page geometry, no horizontal overflow, input/button keyboard focus, consent heading focus with reset scroll position, and mobile action footers that remain at the viewport bottom while content scrolls. Phone/code and consent omit account-switch actions. Synthetic HTTP requests, host receipts, screenshots, and traces are written to the ignored repository `output/connect-full-page/` directory.

This verifies the real React rendering and user flow. It does not test the external SMS provider, production account backend, or the SDK iframe transport. A separate journey opens the real SDK popup and verifies the centered two-column desktop authorization layout.

Four connection-list journeys also cover grouped GitHub/Google rows, the approval gate for missing connections, keyboard focus visibility, and cancellation.

The connection journeys continue through a synthetic Google provider popup, the real origin/source-validated completion message, connector refresh, and explicit Allow access. They capture requested access, waiting for Google, and approval ready on desktop/mobile in both themes. Cancellation and a Gmail-only partial grant keep approval disabled; connecting Calendar still requires explicit final app approval. The provider fixture is clearly labeled local test content, not a reproduction of Google’s consent page.

Appearance journeys verify developer color scheme, accent contrast, font family,
and corner radius across sign-in and approval on desktop/mobile. An SDK popup
journey exercises the URL transport through the hosted parser into the real UI.
Malformed CSS-bearing values fall back to native defaults.

Existing-session journeys use a fixture-only HttpOnly cookie and server-owned
session states. A persistent session with a canonical address opens app consent
without SMS in the dialog, SDK popup, and wizard. No authorization POST or host
approval occurs before Allow access. Coverage includes cancellation,
consent without account-switch actions, an account change in another tab requiring new consent,
initial expiry, expiry during approval, unavailable-session retry, anonymous or
address-less sessions, spending/fresh-auth policy gates, complete permission
visibility for focused requests, and request replacement during delayed hosted
authorization/exchange, closing Connect while authorization is pending, and
React StrictMode effect replay. These run the real public React component against local
HTTP account endpoints; they do not validate production cookie issuance or the
production account service. Per-journey synthetic request/receipt JSON,
screenshots, and Playwright traces are retained under the same ignored output
directory. Run only these journeys with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @nanocodex/connect-dialog run test:browser session.spec.ts
```

The services-only journey (`services.spec.ts`) verifies exact Vault IDs/origins,
phone IDs and action disclosures, absence of agent execution permission, mobile
layout, and explicit approval with unchanged signed service resources. It records
the rendered consent and HTTP request metadata. The account's separate
`pnpm --filter nanocodex-web test:services` journey exercises production Vault and
phone forms against real managed/egress services in workerd with synthetic sign-in
and carrier fixtures.
## Login cookie and latency

The HTTPS cookie journey runs the actual account proxy, managed auth routes and
SQLite Durable Objects in workerd, with production React and a real browser.
Only Twilio, wallet metadata and requesting-app metadata are synthetic. It checks
SMS cookie issuance, HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite attributes, reuse in a second page,
explicit consent, logout, expiry and the session route's `Server-Timing` header:

```sh
node --test js/managed/test/connect-browser-cookie-journey.test.mjs
```

Evidence is retained in `output/cookie-profile/`; no session cookie values are
included. This journey does not send live SMS or approve a production grant.

To profile the production-built UI with reproducible 0/150ms API latency:

```sh
pnpm --filter @nanocodex/connect-dialog run build
cd js/connect-dialog
pnpm exec vite build --config test/browser/profile.vite.config.ts
PROFILE_LABEL=baseline node test/browser/profile.mjs
```

Use distinct labels before/after a change. `output/connect-profile/<label>/`
contains API start/completion times, resource timings, screenshots and traces.
The regular Connect fixture exercises the real component, not SDK popup
transport. Automated milestones include browser-driver polling overhead; use
request dependency timings to compare network waits. This synthetic profile
cannot measure production backend latency. On successful `/v1/me` responses,
`connect_session`, `connect_metadata` and `connect_total` report server durations
in milliseconds without credentials or account identifiers.
