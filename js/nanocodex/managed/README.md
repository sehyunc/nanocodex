# Managed Nanocodex agents

`nanocodex/managed` is the administration and extended control-plane client for
account-owned Nanocodex agents. Application turns normally use
`Agent.create({ transport: Transport.managed(...), tools })` from
`nanocodex/node`, `nanocodex/browser`, or `nanocodex/host`, which returns the
same lifecycle shape as local OpenAI and host-managed transports.

In a browser, authentication uses the current origin's HttpOnly account cookie:

```js
import { Agent } from "nanocodex/managed";

const { agent, turn } = await Agent.createAndPrompt({
  idempotencyKey: `run:${job.id}`,
  input: "Inspect the repository and summarize it.",
});
const result = await turn.result();
console.log(result.finalMessage);
```

`createAndPrompt` sends one client mutation. Its required key identifies both
the new session and the admitted first turn across retries or a lost response.
Later turns still use `agent.turn.prompt(...)`.

New managed agents may be created with an atomic settings object. Existing
agents retain their model and reasoning mode after their first accepted turn.

```js
const astra = await Agent.create({
  settings: {
    model: "gpt-6-astra",
    thinking: "high",
    reasoningMode: "standard",
    fastMode: false,
  },
});
```

GPT-6 Astra accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` thinking; it
rejects `none`. Fast mode is deliberately opt-in and is unavailable for Astra
when the OpenAI project uses EU data residency.

On a server, provide the managed origin and an `ncx_live_...` account API key:

```js
const agent = await Agent.get(process.env.NANOCODEX_AGENT_ID, {
  baseUrl: "https://nanocodex.example",
  apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY,
});
```

The transport-facing constructor requires an explicit identity and never
infers creation from a missing ID:

```js
import { Agent, Transport } from "nanocodex/node";

const created = await Agent.create({
  transport: Transport.managed({
    agent: { create: true },
    baseUrl: "https://nanocodex.example",
    apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY,
  }),
});
const existing = await Agent.create({
  transport: Transport.managed({
    agent: { id: process.env.NANOCODEX_AGENT_ID },
    baseUrl: "https://nanocodex.example",
    apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY,
  }),
});
await existing.session.shutdown(); // closes the client; never deletes the Agent
```

The same account client can search all completed managed conversations without
opening an agent turn:

```js
const found = await Agent.findSessions(
  { query: "what did we decide about memory?", limit: 8 },
  { baseUrl: process.env.NANOCODEX_MANAGED_URL, apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY },
);
const session = await Agent.readSession(
  {
    session_id: found.results[0].session_id,
    turn_ids: [found.results[0].turn_id],
  },
  { baseUrl: process.env.NANOCODEX_MANAGED_URL, apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY },
);
```

Both methods derive the account scope from the cookie or API key; no scope or user
identifier is accepted from the caller.

Browser account owners can read and rename their organization:

```js
const organization = await Agent.getOrganization();
await Agent.updateOrganization({ name: `${organization.name ?? "Personal"} workspace` });
```

Memory accepts either account-cookie or API-key authentication. Organization
metadata and mutation remain subject to the server's principal and owner policy;
the client sends supplied credentials without weakening that policy.

`Agent.list()` returns agent handles, `agent.state()` reads current state, and
`agent.delete()` removes the agent and its retained state. `agent.events.watch`
is an async iterator over durable events. Pass its last decimal `cursor` to a
later watcher to resume strictly after the acknowledged event. Network endings
reconnect automatically from that cursor. Watchers and independently awaitable
turn results on one agent handle share one replayable event connection; each
subscriber keeps its own cursor, so consuming one never steals another's events.
Rapid `turn.steer()` calls on one turn handle are sent in invocation order.
`turn.cancel()` bypasses pending steering requests, so Stop can interrupt them.
Pass `cursor: "latest"` to attach atomically at the durable head without
replaying retained history; a history page can then hydrate independently.

Returning browser clients may use `Agent.open(id)` to construct a retained
handle without a preliminary state request. The first operation on that handle
still verifies account ownership at the managed service boundary. Use
`Agent.get(id)` when an eager existence check is part of the caller's workflow.

The managed API never accepts model-provider credentials, egress bindings,
runtime environment objects, credential grants, or arbitrary request headers.

## Cron triggers

Schedules belong to an existing managed agent and run without an open client.
Use a stable trigger ID to create or replace a schedule idempotently:

```js
const agent = await Agent.get(agentId, { baseUrl, apiKey });
const morning = {
  cron: "0 7 * * MON-FRI",
  timezone: "Europe/Athens",
  input: "Review my running agents and summarize anything that needs attention.",
};
await agent.triggers.put("morning-review", morning);
await agent.triggers.list();
await agent.triggers.get("morning-review");
await agent.triggers.update("morning-review", { enabled: false }); // pause
await agent.triggers.update("morning-review", { enabled: true }); // resume
await agent.triggers.update("morning-review", { cron: "30 9 * * *" }); // preserve other fields
await agent.triggers.delete("morning-review");
```

| Method | Route | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/agents/:agent/triggers` | `{ data: [...] }` |
| GET | `/v1/agents/:agent/triggers/:id` | Trigger or 404 |
| PUT | `/v1/agents/:agent/triggers/:id` | Create (201) or replace (200) |
| PATCH | `/v1/agents/:agent/triggers/:id` | Partial update (200), or 404 |
| DELETE | `/v1/agents/:agent/triggers/:id` | Idempotent deletion (204) |

The managed-agent web composer also has a **Schedules** button. It opens the
same account-authenticated API: create or edit a prompt and cron expression,
choose an IANA time zone, inspect the next dispatch time, pause/resume, or
delete a schedule. The last-dispatched time is not a completion receipt; read
the conversation for the result. The ephemeral homepage agent has no schedules.

PUT takes `{ cron, input, timezone?, enabled?, session_mode? }`. Expressions have five fields
(minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week), supporting numeric values,
lists, ranges, steps, and month/day names. The time zone defaults to UTC and
accepts IANA names. Local times follow daylight saving transitions. Seconds,
macros, and random `H` fields are rejected. Inputs must be non-empty text.
IDs use 1–64 letters, digits,
underscores, or hyphens. PUT is a full replacement; an identical retry preserves
the next occurrence. PATCH (SDK `triggers.update`) changes only supplied fields
and requires an existing schedule. A concurrent edit may return 409; refresh
before deciding which changes to retry. A changed configuration starts from the next matching time.

`session_mode: "new"` (the default for new configurations) creates a fresh managed
session for every occurrence. It copies the source agent's model settings at
dispatch time, but no conversation history or schedules. Account permissions,
connectors, and account memory still belong to the same account. Fresh sessions
run independently even when the source conversation is busy, and appear in the
normal agent list. Choose **New session each time** in the Schedules dialog.

`session_mode: "continue"` submits a turn to the existing conversation, retaining
its history. Choose **Continue this conversation** in the dialog. Schedules saved
before modes were introduced retain this behavior. Omitting the mode when
updating an existing schedule preserves its mode, including for older clients.
Set `session_mode` explicitly to switch modes.

Durable Object alarms dispatch occurrences. Continued turns advance the schedule
atomically with turn admission. Fresh runs use a durable outbox and deterministic
session/turn IDs: delivery retries reuse the same session without duplicating
its turn. Only one undelivered occurrence per schedule is retained. Inspect
`last_turn_id` on `last_agent_id` through the normal turn and event APIs, or use
**Open run** in the UI. Times are Unix milliseconds; `last_run_at` is the scheduled
time of the last accepted occurrence, and `next_run_at` is null while paused.
Last dispatched does not mean the model response has completed.

Missed ticks coalesce; they are not replayed individually. In continue mode,
unfinished work or a failed event stream causes an occurrence to be skipped and
recorded in `last_skipped_at`. New-session mode does not skip because the source
is busy. Pausing or deleting prevents future dispatches; a turn already accepted
or a fresh session already claimed for delivery still completes. Resume does
not backfill. Deleting the source removes its schedules and pending deliveries;
sessions already created remain independent conversations.

Read requests require `agents:read`; writes require `agents:write`, and PUT also
requires `tools:use`. The usual ownership and browser-origin checks apply.
Triggers are account-owned standing instructions with the creator's capability
scope, and persist after the creating API key or browser session ends. Connect
grants and multiplayer rooms cannot create schedules. Delete the trigger to
revoke its standing instruction. Provider credentials are resolved by the usual
managed execution path and are never stored in trigger definitions or returned
by these endpoints.

Deleting an agent removes its triggers. Portable durability export currently
returns `409 cron_triggers_present` while any trigger or pending delivery exists: delete
triggers and let claimed deliveries finish before transfer, then recreate schedules at the destination. This avoids
silently dropping schedules or running the same schedule on two agents.
