# managed2 (greenfield)

One public API Worker → one Session Durable Object per agent → standard
`nanocodex/cloudflare` JS/WASM Agent → private `egress2` service binding.
Every model turn uses Code Mode. The model receives only `exec` and `wait`;
`current_time`, `exec_command`, and `web__run` are available through `tools.*`
inside `exec`. QuickJS initializes lazily on the first code execution.
No connector tools or old-session migration are included in this slice.

## Authentication

Send `Authorization: Bearer ncx2_<43 base64url characters>` on each API call.
`AUTH_API_KEY_HASHES` is a required Worker **secret** containing a JSON object from
base64url SHA-256 of each whole API key to its canonical owner UUID. Managed2
hashes the presented key and resolves its owner locally in the Worker isolate;
there is no Account Worker or DO lookup per request. No raw API keys are stored
in the Worker. Replace the secret map to rotate/revoke keys. This dedicated
Managed2 key is distinct from production `ncx_live_*` keys (those need their
Account Worker directory lookup to resolve ownership).

The initial owner key is provisioned to a mode-0600 file on the user's Mac,
not in the repository or `/brain`. Anyone holding it has full read/write access
to that owner's Managed2 agents and credential-import endpoint. Keep it private.

## API and model boundary

`POST /v1/agents` with an optional `{ "input": "..." }` first turn,
`POST /v1/agents/:id/turns` (optional UUID `Idempotency-Key`),
`GET /v1/agents/:id/turns/:turnId`, and WebSocket
`GET /v1/agents/:id/events?cursor=...`. `PUT /v1/credentials/openai` uploads
a provider key; `PUT /v1/credentials/chatgpt` imports a subscription using
`{access_token, refresh_token, account_id, expires_at, fedramp}`. The API
briefly handles uploaded provider credentials, then sends them to Egress2's
per-owner credential DO. The Agent receives no provider credential.

The combined create request returns `202 { agent_id, turn_id, state: "accepted" }`;
create without a body still returns `201 { agent_id }`. A caller-provided UUID
`Idempotency-Key` on create fixes the agent ID (and first turn ID), so retrying
the same body does not create another agent or turn. The first turn is admitted
inside the same Session DO call; fetch `/v1/agents/:id/events?cursor=0` after
create to replay any events already emitted, or poll the returned turn ID.

The standard WASM Agent owns history, checkpoints, tool-step durability, and
cursor-resumable WebSocket events in Session SQLite. A turn's accepted ID/input
is retained for alarm reconciliation. Egress2 swaps the SDK placeholder for the
owner's active provider credential, with a 60-second isolate credential cache;
the credential DO encrypts the stored key and opaque Rust subscription payload.

This slice pins `gpt-6.1-sol`/low. It runs alongside, rather than replacing,
the existing managed API. The subscription path uses Egress2’s Cloudflare Gateway VPC binding and skips
the account-owned `ChatGptEgress` relay/container. That regional relay remains
a rollback route if the VPC binding is removed from Egress2. Managed2 uses a persistent
Responses WebSocket (`RESPONSES_TRANSPORT=websocket`).

```text
Client → Managed2 API → Session DO → Egress2 → VPC/Gateway → ChatGPT
                          state          │
                                    UserCredentials DO (cache miss/refresh)
```

The API Worker hashes its dedicated account key locally. The Session DO owns
turn admission, replayable events and the model socket. Egress2 substitutes the
provider credential; its isolate cache avoids a credential DO lookup on every
model/tool step. The credential DO retains the encrypted secret and refresh
token. Neither Managed2 nor Egress2 replaces the original Managed API or its
existing public ingress; clients must explicitly use the Managed2 hostname.
The private Egress2 service binding must not be exposed as a public HTTP route.

In a small staging two-tool trial, relay+WebSocket matched relay+HTTP at 6.53 s
median first-turn completion and measured 5.19 s versus 5.94 s on the second
turn. These samples do not prove a general latency improvement. HTTP and persistent-WebSocket
model→Code Mode→tool→model journeys verify that only `exec` and `wait` are
exposed, alongside credential isolation, durable Bash storage, and tool timing.

## Latency observation

Run `./managed2-demo "Reply with exactly: Timing check complete."` for a real
create, replayable event stream, final-text TTFT, and durable turn-status check.
The API returns `Server-Timing` for `auth`, `body_parse`, `session`,
`api_total`, `do_route`, `do_total`, `agent_init`, and `admission`. `session` includes the
Session DO wake, constructor, routing, initialization and turn admission; it is
**not** additive with `agent_init` or `admission`. `api_total` includes `session`
and excludes pre-Worker startup/network. `do_route` is the time from DO fetch
entry to the turn-dispatch path; `do_total` is the complete DO request. The
`session - do_total` residual approximates DO routing/scheduling and RPC
overhead, **not** a precise Worker cold-start measurement. A 101 upgrade cannot carry a constructed
`Server-Timing` response; `managed2.events_connect` logs auth, Session upgrade,
and total handshake time without owner IDs, prompts, or response contents.

The durable `GET /v1/agents/:id/turns/:turnId` response also includes a
`timing` object with a random `trace_id`, `agent_init_ms` duration, and elapsed
milliseconds since admission started for `accepted_ms`, `model_send_ms`,
`first_provider_event_ms`, `first_delta_ms`, `first_answer_delta_ms`, and
`result_ms`. The tool increment also records `first_model_call_ms`,
`first_tool_call_ms`, `first_tool_result_ms`, `post_tool_model_call_ms`,
`post_tool_model_send_ms` (WebSocket only), `tool_calls`, and total
`tool_duration_ms`. Each durable turn status also contains a `tool_timing` array
with one content-free row per call: call ID, name, start wall-clock and elapsed
turn time, result time/status, Rust-measured duration, and named handler phases
with their measured durations and invocation counts. It never stores arguments
or results. `managed2.tool_call` and `managed2.tool_result` logs carry the same
trace ID and call ID to correlate a particular call without logging its input.
A tool can record phases such as VFS hydrate, interpreter setup, execution,
persist/flush, upstream dispatch, and result parsing. Missing phases are
unknown, not zero. The model-call timestamps are logical Agent events, not
wire-send observations. The post-tool send distinguishes local tool execution
from the second provider round trip; null means unobserved, not zero.

The model-send observation runs just after the persistent socket
sends `response.create`. The first provider event is the first inbound
`api.event` seen by the Agent, not a raw socket-read timestamp; the difference
approximates upstream wait plus frame parsing. If concurrent turns make socket
attribution ambiguous, `model_send_ms` stays null. The content-free send
observer remains active past 32 turns on a persistent socket. Missing milestones remain `null`;
rehydration may prevent a first-delta observation. The first-delta clock is
server-side emission, **not** client receipt. On a cold agent `agent_init_ms`
includes WASM restore/startup and the persistent Responses socket preconnect;
it cannot separate them from this public Agent boundary. A warm turn can reuse
that socket without a new Egress fetch. Client-to-server residuals include
network, edge dispatch, and Worker activation, not just platform startup.

`managed2.model_route`, `managed2.agent_ready`, `managed2.model_send`,
`managed2.first_provider_event`, `managed2.turn_first_delta`,
`managed2.turn_first_answer_delta`, and `managed2.turn_result` share the trace
ID. The initial model-route log is a socket **preconnect**, not a per-turn
model request. Egress2 logs the same validated trace ID, its own relay request
ID, credential cache/lookup, upstream handshake, and one 401 recovery/retry
when applicable. The account-owned `ChatGptEgress` log links that relay request
ID to its locally generated relay ID; the relay-container log reports DNS,
TCP, TLS and upstream upgrade timings for the same relay ID. Egress `101`
timing exists in logs, not headers. Egress header time ends at WebSocket handshake or HTTP response headers.
The new per-turn send/first-inbound-event spans separate local turn preparation
from upstream wait but still do **not** isolate provider inference, queueing,
network, or raw first-frame transit within that upstream interval. Do not subtract an
Egress preconnect span from a warm turn or claim these spans are all additive.

No log contains keys, owner/account IDs, prompts, message text, upstream
headers or bodies. Persistent Worker logs/traces are sampled at 100%; use
Cloudflare Observability or `wrangler tail` to filter the fixed event names.
The shared `nanocodex/cloudflare/tracing` adapter records exception events with
fixed operation codes on failed spans, including failures reported by model
events. It never forwards caught error messages or stacks, which can contain
prompt text or credentials. Active invocation spans receive authentication
outcomes; child spans retain their turn correlation and nesting. Bulk attributes
and exception events use the September 2026 runtime APIs when available; the
pinned older local workerd retains individual attributes and `error.type`.
`startSpan` is intentionally not used for model event pairs: they may arrive in
separate invocations, and a manually ended span cannot join those contexts.

External container/provider spans are not in the Cloudflare trace. A request,
stream connection, and alarm-resumed turn may have separate trace roots;
`0ms` spans can be timer-resolution artifacts.

## Parallel rollout

These Workers have distinct names and Durable Object namespaces from the existing
managed API. They do not change its account ingress, service bindings or
migrations. Egress2 is private (`workers_dev: false`) and must be deployed before
Managed2, whose dedicated `workers.dev` endpoint is the opt-in public ingress:

```sh
pnpm --filter nanocodex-egress2-service run build
pnpm --filter nanocodex-managed2 run build
# After verifying the existing secret names and intended owner/test account:
cd js/egress2 && npx wrangler deploy --env="" --config wrangler.jsonc
cd ../managed2 && npx wrangler deploy --env="" --config wrangler.jsonc
```

Egress2 requires its existing `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret to read stored
credentials. Managed2 requires `AUTH_API_KEY_HASHES`; Wrangler secret values are
not stored in source and are not inherited from the original managed API. Do not
rotate either casually: an encryption-key change loses access to existing sealed
records, and an auth-map change can revoke every Managed2 client. Before and
after deployment, check unauthenticated `POST /v1/agents` returns 401, run an
authorized create/turn/replay with `./managed2-demo`, and verify the original
account `/api/health` still returns 200. Neither endpoint's success alone proves
model completion; check the turn status and streamed answer.

## Tool observability and sandbox-free tools

`GET /v1/agents/:id/turns/:turn` includes `tool_timing` for the Code Mode wrapper
and each nested tool call ID: name,
status, start/result offset, duration, and accumulated phase timings. These rows are
persisted in Session SQLite without arguments, results, file contents, or search queries.
Nested tool timings retain the original registered tool name and handler phases.
The turn’s `tool_calls` counts both the `exec` wrapper and nested calls; their
durations overlap and must not be added as independent elapsed time.
The generic wrapper applies to every registered tool. `exec_command` lazily loads an
in-process Bash interpreter and a per-agent durable `/brain` VFS; its phases are
`setup`, `vfs_hydrate`, `execute`, `vfs_flush`, and outer `handler`. It does not
start a sandbox or offer an unmediated network. `web__run` uses Egress2's private
fixed search route and reports `preparation`, `egress_dispatch`, `parse`,
`egress_credential`, `egress_upstream`, `egress_parse`, and outer `handler`.
Nested spans are not additive (dispatch includes upstream).

The `clock: "io_gated"` marker matters: deployed Cloudflare Workers freeze
`performance.now()` and `Date.now()` during CPU-only work. Thus a `0ms` Bash
setup/VFS/execute phase is **unmeasurable**, not proof that it was free. I/O
spans such as search upstream are measurable. For CPU hotspots use workerd's
local CPU profile plus Cloudflare invocation CPU metrics; client-side tool-call
to-result elapsed includes event delivery and is not a pure handler duration.

## Regional subscription relay placement

Only new agents record a relay region derived from `request.cf.colo` at the
authenticated create endpoint. Caller-supplied region headers are ignored.
The selection persists in the Session SQLite row for alarm/reconnect traffic;
preexisting agents keep their legacy route. The region is only a Cloudflare
best-effort placement hint, not a residency guarantee. Egress2 picks a fresh
account-owned regional Container class and identity for ChatGPT subscription
calls; API-key calls remain direct. This is not a claim that OpenAI inference
occurs in the selected region or that provider response time will improve.
