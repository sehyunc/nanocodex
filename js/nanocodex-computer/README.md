# nanocodex-computer

MCP attachment for the official OpenAI CUA provider (Sky on macOS). The installed
provider owns its tools, descriptions, schemas, JavaScript API, and permissions.
This package contains no CUA implementation, browser API facade, or fallback
runtime. It launches the provider with its exact trusted command and arguments.

```js
import { connectComputerTools, ensureComputer } from "nanocodex-computer";

const executable = await ensureComputer({ binary: installedNativeHelper });
if (!executable) throw new Error("No official CUA provider is configured");
const computer = await connectComputerTools({ executable });
// Add computer.tools to createTools({ tools, workspace }).
// Read the discovered provider declarations before using any CUA API.
await computer.close();
```

`ensureComputer({ binary })` uses the installed `nanocodex2` or `nanocodex` helper
to provision the official provider on macOS. Automatic Windows setup is disabled
pending native-helper verification. `discoverComputer` is
read-only. Both honor `NANOCODEX_COMPUTER` as an explicit provider executable,
and `off`, `none`, or `0` disable CUA. Neither searches for the retired companion
in PATH, Cargo directories, source builds, or adjacent installations. Unsupported
platforms return no provider unless an explicit MCP executable is configured.
A supported managed receipt supplies its exact arguments and environment.
Mac setup selects immutable host assets separately from the signed bundle. CUA
then starts the direct MCP host, bundled Node/node_repl, and signed Sky helper,
with no official Codex CLI or app server. It enables upstream `browser,computer` surfaces with TinySky and Nanocodex's
own native-message relay. Setup registers manifests for supported installed
browsers, preserves conflicting registrations, and leaves extension installation
and browser profiles unchanged. See the
[managed Mac host](../../docs/computer/direct-mcp-host.md).

`connectComputerTools` discovers the full paginated MCP catalog before exposing
an attachment. `definitions` and each tool's `providerDefinition` preserve the
provider declarations, including optional metadata. The tools are published as
`mcp__cua_repl__<provider name>`. Entries whose `_meta.ui.visibility` excludes
`model` remain available through trusted `tool(name)` lookup. Each conversation
process must present the same catalog. `createComputerTools` is a synchronous
constructor for hosts that already have that trusted discovered catalog; it
never invents one. The `/contract` export contains only namespace name constants.

Trusted `args` and `environment` configure the child process. There are no
companion launch flags, platform arguments, security configuration, private
desktop routing, or protocol switches. The inherited child environment omits
account/API credentials. The provider receives model arguments unchanged,
including its own optional fields and timeouts. The provider exclusively owns
execution deadlines and reset behavior. The adapter does not interpret
`timeout_ms`, add a tool-call deadline, or charge queue wait against a provider
execution budget. Managed installation retains its ten-minute bound; provider
initialization and full catalog discovery have a separate 120-second bound that
ends before any tool call is dispatched.

Each conversation has its own process and ordered call queue. Independent
conversations run concurrently. Caller cancellation stops the active transport;
queued cancellation rejects without running that call or stopping active work.
Session release and attachment close cancel their active and queued work. Closing
the transport cannot guarantee that dispatched native work stopped or that its
effects were rolled back; cancellation after dispatch reports uncertain
completion. After a dispatched call is interrupted by cancellation or transport
failure, that conversation requires an explicit `js_reset` before continuing.
Reset starts a fresh provider transport and forwards the provider's reset call;
it does not prove earlier native input stopped. Inspect the surface after reset
and do not replay uncertain input. Queued cancellation does not require reset.
The adapter never retries a failed call automatically.

MCP results and metadata remain available unchanged as the tool result's `value`.
Text, images, and audio are translated into model content; other MCP content is
represented as its JSON text. Images retain the provider's declared MIME type
and use original detail. The adapter does not reinterpret screenshot bytes.

CUA calls carry `session_id`, `thread_id`, `call_id`, and `model` in
`x-codex-turn-metadata`, plus `turn_id` when supplied by the agent runtime. The
adapter never derives a turn ID from a tool call ID.

Native protected-target checks and OS permissions remain upstream/OS-owned.
The managed Mac host supplies blanket application-access consent from trusted
host policy; this is not authorization for external actions or audio/data forms.
The opt-in Linux Sky host runs without Codex on X11/Xwayland; automatic Windows
upstream setup remains unsupported. The attachment
advertises no MCP client capabilities and responds to incoming provider RPC
requests with standard method-not-found (`-32601`) errors. Provider notifications
receive no response.

Run `pnpm --filter nanocodex-computer test` and
`pnpm --filter nanocodex-computer typecheck`. Tests use synthetic MCP protocol
fixtures; they do not ship a replacement CUA runtime. See
[provider installation](../../docs/computer/upstream-provider.md).
