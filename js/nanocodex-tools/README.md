# nanocodex-tools

Reusable, platform-neutral JavaScript tools for Nanocodex agents: the common
tool router and Code Mode runtime, attachment and hosted-tool protocols,
artifact and dataset tools, persistent
workspace adaptation, a bounded Just Bash runtime, Git/GitHub compatibility
commands, repository materialization, and workspace-backed SSH composition.
Session-search parsing, retrieval policy, and bounded model-visible projections
are exposed through the dedicated `nanocodex-tools/session` entrypoint.

`nanocodex-tools/x` exports the native `browseX({ fetch })` tool, its request
validator, and `X_API` discovery metadata. Hosts inject transport to the
[Nanocodex X Worker](../x-api/README.md); provider access stays in that Worker.

Hosts own persistence, network policy, credentials, and socket transports and
inject those capabilities through the package's narrow interfaces.

`nanocodex` owns the Rust/WASM agent runtime and composes WASM, workspace, and
MCP adapters around these capabilities. It imports and reexports this package's
JS-only host capabilities; `nanocodex-tools` never imports `nanocodex`.

Cloudflare Workers may supply Durable Object persistence and WebSocket
registries to the hosted-tools core, but Cloudflare bindings, account authority,
Connect grants, and storage schemas remain owned by those Workers.

`nanocodex-tools/node` supplies native `exec_command` and `write_stdin` pipe
sessions for explicitly authorized desktop/Node Hands. Processes use an explicit
workspace cwd and a small environment allowlist, and sessions are fenced by the
calling agent. The workspace is not an OS sandbox; hosts must make the native
authority clear and use a VM for isolation. Closing the runtime terminates owned
processes. This entrypoint imports Node APIs and must not be bundled into Workers
or browser applications.

Native Node Hands retain unread command output in private temporary files. Reply
budgets control each poll, without discarding older output. Files are removed
when fully consumed or when their owning session or Hand is closed.
