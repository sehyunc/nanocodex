# Workers WhatsApp runtime preparation

`pnpm --dir js/egress prepare:whatsapp` builds the ignored
`src/whatsapp-generated/baileys.js` and `bridge.wasm`. Run it from Wrangler's
custom build command, and alias `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to
`./src/whatsapp-generated/baileys.js` in the broker configuration. Keep the
`CompiledWasm` rule and `nodejs_compat` flag enabled.

Dependencies pin Baileys 7.0.0-rc14, whatsapp-rust-bridge 0.5.4 and
@noble/hashes 2.4.0. Preparation
verifies both the bridge source and its scalar WASM hashes before replacing
runtime WASM compilation with a Workers module import. No cryptographic
algorithm is reimplemented. A guarded Baileys compatibility patch propagates
libsignal's false signature-verification result instead of accepting it.
The Baileys crypto module is also hash-checked before its narrow adaptations.
Upgrading these packages requires reviewing the checks and repeating the
real workerd crypto and WebSocket journey.

The WebSocket adapter uses Workers fetch upgrades. Protocol logging is silent.
Preparation drops direct console calls throughout the protocol dependency bundle,
including libsignal session lifecycle diagnostics that otherwise print private
ratchet and root keys despite the silent pino logger. This applies only to the
generated protocol bundle; broker diagnostics remain available. Its transitive
`debug` dependency is also replaced with a no-op logger, preventing media metadata
diagnostics from reaching stderr even when debugging is enabled in the environment. Media
transformation dependencies fail closed. The runtime only projects
received data and exposes pairing, close, logout, and keyed history requests.
Authentication persistence belongs to the external encrypted account store.

The crypto adapter also omits `setAAD` when authenticated data is empty.
workerd's Node-compatible GCM implementation otherwise fails authentication
on the empty-AAD transport used after Noise initialization. Omitting that call
has identical AEAD semantics; encryption and authenticated decryption still use
native `node:crypto`. Both empty/nonempty AAD and tamper rejection are verified.

Pairing-key derivation uses `@noble/hashes`' asynchronous PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
implementation with the protocol's exact 131,072 iterations and 32-byte output.
Production Workers caps both WebCrypto and Node-native PBKDF2 at 100,000
iterations; standalone workerd does not enforce that limit. The guarded crypto
module transform replaces only `derivePairingCodeKey`; it does not alter global
crypto APIs or weaken the protocol's work factor. Synthetic ASCII and UTF-8
vectors (including a salt view with an offset) compare every output byte against
independent Node `pbkdf2Sync` results through the shipped bundle. These checks do
not request a pairing code or contact an account. Repeat the synthetic KDF proof
in remote Workers when upgrading: an anonymous Noise handshake alone never
exercises this pairing-only step.

Reproduce the protocol journey from the repository with Node 24:

```sh
pnpm --dir js/egress test:whatsapp-runtime
pnpm --dir js/egress test:whatsapp-runtime --upstream
node js/egress/test/whatsapp-runtime/node-upstream.mjs
```

The default journey uses an actual local binary WebSocket echo service and
actual workerd. It also establishes Signal sessions between two synthetic peers,
encrypts/decrypts messages, replaces both outgoing and incoming sessions, and
asserts that the shipped protocol bundle makes zero console calls. Console
arguments are never retained or printed by this check. This narrow integration
uses in-memory auth storage because the anonymous upstream handshake cannot
exercise authenticated Signal lifecycle transitions; it requires no real account
or phone linking. `--upstream` also performs an anonymous WhatsApp Noise handshake
and verifies pairing-ready. It never requests a phone number, registers a
linked device, or emits QR/code/credentials. The optional Node command is an
upstream comparison. Diagnostics are bounded to known protocol labels, frame
lengths and close status. Evidence is written to ignored
`output/whatsapp-runtime/`; no external lab checkout is required.

The runtime requests full history using `Browsers.macOS('Desktop')` and the
currently published WhatsApp Web version (bundled fallback); stale versions
make phones reject phone-number linking. This is an
upstream-documented desktop profile. Full-history coverage is reported
conservatively, since a linked device may receive only partial data.
The workerd journey uses the same Miniflare version as Wrangler and the broker's
`2026-07-29` compatibility date.
