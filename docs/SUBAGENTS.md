# Tact-compatible subagents

Nanocodex’s native CLI ports the subagent runtime from
[`clabby/tact@1d9ccaefd1d8613dab020812af04a91cd9b4c52c`](https://github.com/clabby/tact/tree/1d9ccaefd1d8613dab020812af04a91cd9b4c52c)
under Apache-2.0. The runtime adapts Tact’s lifecycle, messaging, capacity policy, and focused
tests. Integration changes include Nanocodex module paths, removal of Tact’s separate memory-tool
coupling, CLI configuration, event draining, shutdown wiring, and explicit
propagation of Nanocodex’s originating tool span into the child harness.

Subagents are enabled by default for TUI and one-shot runs:

```sh
nanocodex --max-subagents 32
nanocodex run --max-subagents 32 "implement the change"
```

Pass `--subagents false` or set `NANOCODEX_SUBAGENTS=false` to disable the
general-purpose subagent tools for a session.

When enabled, the root agent also receives Tact's fixed orchestration guidance:
delegate only meaningful separable work, run independent children concurrently,
use their typed outputs for dependent stages, avoid repeating delegated work,
verify their findings, and keep concurrent write scopes disjoint.

`--max-subagents` bounds active child turns across the complete task tree. Idle
reusable sessions consume no capacity. Lowering the limit does not cancel work;
new reservations fail until active work falls below the limit.

## Tool contract

An enabled runtime installs seven tools for root and child agents:

| Tool | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `spawn_agent` | Create a clean child session with a role, focused task, strict typed output contract, and nullable model/thinking overrides. |
| `submit_result` | Submit `{output}` against the child’s schema and the runtime’s trusted instruction revision. |
| `send_agent_message` | Send a bounded directed message within the current task tree. |
| `list_agents` | List visible agents, status, topology, and caller authority. |
| `wait_agent` | Wait until any selected agent reaches a terminal state. |
| `interrupt_agent` | Stop an active subtree while keeping its sessions reusable. |
| `close_agent` | Close an agent and its descendants permanently. |

Each child starts without inherited conversation history. Its initial prompt
contains its role, task, tree identity, coordination rules, and output schema.
Call `submit_result({output})` with a schema-valid value. The runtime binds the
submission to the instruction revision of the model request; the model supplies
no turn token. An accepted result returns `{accepted: true, status: "accepted"}`.
If steering superseded that request, the tool returns
`{accepted: false, status: "superseded"}` as a normal continuation, not an error.
Incorporate the updated instructions and submit again. Only an accepted result
satisfies the child’s completion contract.

Model and thinking overrides apply only to the new child. In the strict
model-facing tool, pass `null` for either value to inherit the invoking agent’s
setting. Its `output_contract` uses closed object/array/scalar nodes, compiled
into a JSON Schema before launch. Trusted programmatic APIs still accept raw
JSON Schema; legacy in-flight tool calls may complete with `output_schema`.

## Tree authority and messaging

Every root session owns an isolated task tree with IDs local to that tree. The
root can manage all descendants; a child can manage only its descendants, not
siblings or ancestors. Ordinary coordination may cross sibling branches.
Authorization is enforced by the runtime.

Messages are limited to 2 KiB of UTF-8 and retain typed priority, purpose, and
reply metadata. Deferred delivery starts an idle recipient or queues behind an
active turn. Urgent delivery steers a running turn at the next safe model
boundary. Delegate messages replace the recipient’s task while preserving its
output schema and require management authority. Deferred and urgent mailboxes
are independently bounded.

## Lifecycle

One active child turn reserves one shared capacity slot. Completion, failure,
interruption, or closure releases it. `wait_agent` defaults to 30 seconds and
caps waits at 300 seconds without cancelling on timeout. Interrupt and close
operate in descendant-first order with a 30-second cleanup deadline.

The CLI closes all remaining descendants before shutting down the root runtime.
Child harness tasks, model/tool work, and event-forwarding tasks are joined or
bounded during cleanup. Subagents share the root’s provider, workspace, base
tools, and process authority; clean conversation context is not a security
sandbox.

A durable root in the JavaScript hosts opens a durable child tree on its existing
store. Child IDs, ownership, mailboxes, results, and independent execution
checkpoints survive reconstruction. Saved host context never grants authority:
the host reapplies current capabilities before resuming each child. On native
targets, `nanocodex::DurableAgentExt` installs the registry, per-child journals,
and same-family factory automatically for OpenAI and Claude (with the `claude`
feature). Lower-level users of `nanocodex_durability::DurableAgentExt` configure
the registry, durable factory, and ownership hooks explicitly; a plain in-memory
registry retains its original process lifetime. Automatic native composition
rejects existing spawn factories, so custom or mixed-family routing uses the
core adapter with explicit recipes.

Native facade builds start child recovery after binding the owner. Await
`agent.ready()` to observe completion or a retained startup failure; prompts
also await it. Background children can recover after a completed root turn
without submitting another root prompt. Shutdown and last-handle drop cancel
unfinished startup recovery.

`foreground` and `background` lifetimes express ownership separately from
whether a driver is resident in memory. Background children require durability;
the managed scheduler retains wakeups after the foreground turn ends. Explicit
interrupt and close operations remain recoverable across a process exit. See
[durability ownership](DURABILITY.md#agent-identity-and-child-ownership).

Tact’s subagent tree TUI is presentation owned by Tact and is not copied into
Nanocodex’s existing Ratatui application. Nanocodex drains the same typed
runtime updates so lifecycle observation remains independent of the scheduler.

## Local real-model spawn check

Build the current branch's WebAssembly package, then opt in to a live provider
call (Cloudflare AI credentials stay in the local Node process):

```sh
bash js/nanocodex-vite/scripts/build-js-package.sh
NANOCODEX_LIVE_ENV_FILE=/path/to/private/.env \
  NANOCODEX_LIVE_SPAWN_SCENARIO=natural \
  node js/nanocodex/scripts/live-spawn-harness.mjs
```

The harness uses the built Rust/WASM tool definitions, forwards them to a real
model, asserts the provider received `strict: true`, and verifies an actual
child submission and completed `wait_agent` result. It makes up to 12 model
requests; no test credentials or provider error bodies are printed. Environment
variables `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN` and `NANOCODEX_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` can
be provided by the process instead of a file. This check does not deploy the
Worker or test account-side scheduling.
