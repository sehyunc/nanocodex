# Preference-aware thread routing

Routing is opt-in per new agent; omitting `configuration.model_routing` preserves existing client behavior. For opted-in agents, the default routing strategy is `direct`. At initial admission, one Jev request chooses a supported model **and thinking level**. Subsequent turns reuse the persisted choice; changes in later messages do not reroute the thread. The Rust agent loop and provider transports remain the same.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "model_routing": {
      "strategy": "direct",
      "preferences": {
        "completion": 60,
        "cost": 25,
        "duration": 15,
        "text": "Prefer inexpensive execution for routine work; prioritize correctness for difficult changes.",
        "target_cost_usd": 1,
        "target_duration_seconds": 120
      },
      "min_confidence": 0.75,
      "low_confidence_fallback": "proposed"
    }
  }
}
```

Numeric preferences are relative importance weights from 0 to 100, not probabilities or percentages of traffic. Higher completion weight favors successful task completion; higher cost weight favors economy; higher duration weight favors shorter elapsed task time. Omitted preferences can be inferred by Jev from the opening prompt or optional preference text. Explicit numeric settings take precedence over conflicting text. The router does not use keyword matching to infer preferences.

Cost and duration targets are soft planning targets. They do not impose a spending cap or runtime deadline, and routing does not guarantee them. Missing cost/time observations remain unknown. Subscription API-equivalent cost is not cash billed to the subscription. Successful completion means independently verified task success, not merely reaching an agent terminal state.

The native choices are GLM-5.3 and the Astra, Sol, and Luna ChatGPT models, each at low, medium, and high thinking. Configured gateways add supported provider/model/effort combinations, including the existing Kimi and MiMo routes; unavailable providers are excluded before Jev. Candidate availability follows each provider catalog. This is not the entire Cloudflare catalog. To restrict the choices, pass `candidates` containing exact IDs, for example:

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    "@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3:low",
    "@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3:medium",
    "gpt-6-astra:high"
  ]
}
```

Candidate eligibility and output validity are enforced in code. In policy version `jev-direct-v4`, `min_confidence` remains 0.75 by default. With the default proposed setting, the threshold labels uncertainty rather than preventing use of a valid proposal. A valid but lower-confidence proposal uses `selection: "fallback"`, with no measured estimate. The default `low_confidence_fallback: "proposed"` retains that eligible proposal so an uncertain economy choice is not silently replaced with the configured frontier model. This is a policy fallback, not increased confidence, calibration, or a guarantee that Jev interpreted the preference correctly. Even zero reported confidence remains a fallback under this setting. Set `low_confidence_fallback: "frontier"` for the previous conservative replacement behavior. This setting affects the direct strategy only.

Invalid, unavailable, malformed, or missing Jev output always uses the conservative eligible fallback, regardless of this setting. The configured frontier model/effort is preferred if eligible, then an eligible ChatGPT candidate, then the first eligible candidate. This deterministic ordering is not a measured quality ranking. No fallback can escape the allowlist. Unsupported opening modalities filter out the text-only GLM route; oversized inputs use the bounded fallback path. A positive measured success threshold fails admission when its evidence requirements are unmet.

## What Jev receives and decides

One request contains the opening task, candidate identities and profiles, explicit preferences, optional preference text, versioned published eval references and caller-supplied `estimates`. Live provider telemetry, geographic cohorts, and synthetic probe results are not included in the current Jev input. Classification has one attempt with a two-second budget; timeout or failure uses the eligible fallback. Typed Choice questions return a candidate and a diagnostic task family. The category is evidence context, not a hardcoded family-to-model lookup. Candidate confidence is routing confidence, not predicted task success.

Published eval scores are priors from different harnesses, not comparable Nanocodex completion rates. The router must not invent Sol/Luna prices or relative performance where measurements are absent. Candidates are not interchangeable: thinking levels change reasoning effort and provider routes can differ in price, latency and availability. Their probabilities are not summed to manufacture confidence. Candidate selection remains provisional without a representative held-out dataset. Record actual task success, full-run cost including failures, elapsed duration, model, thinking and harness version; evaluate routing against fixed-model and evidence-only baselines.

The route's audit record retains the parsed policy, preferences, eligible IDs, proposed and chosen candidates, raw confidence, `confidence_status` and `fallback_basis`. `fallback_basis: valid_proposal` distinguishes retaining an uncertain valid proposal from `eligible_frontier` replacement; `none` identifies an accepted-confidence selection. The settings and route are committed atomically. Restart and concurrent admission reuse that record. A restart before the initial commit may repeat classification.

`strategy: "legacy"` retains the earlier task-family policy and its measured cost/success and duration/success scoring. `oss_thinking` and `frontier_thinking` do not constrain the direct catalog; use `candidates` to constrain effort. The frontier pair still selects the preferred fallback.

The feature requires `NANOCODEX_THREAD_ROUTING=true` and the AI binding. The Worker enables the API but never injects a routing policy: opt in with `{"configuration":{"model_routing":{}}}` when creating a new agent (or explicitly choose a saved definition containing that policy). Existing `nanocodex` and `nanocodex2` requests remain unchanged. Background probes separately require `NANOCODEX_PROVIDER_PROBES=true` and ship disabled. Existing routes remain pinned. See [scheduled probe controls](AGGREGATOR_ROUTING.md#scheduled-ttft-probes).

## Child threads and provider transport

If `multi_agent.enabled` is true, a new child is routed independently with the same policy and current provider availability. Its role/task and any explicit model/thinking overrides determine its eligible choices. The child decision is saved before inference and reused during continuation and driver reconstruction. Durable trees retain the child and its route across a parent runtime restart; reconstruction rechecks current provider credentials and authorization. Saved spawning-turn context is not an authorization grant. An in-memory tree retains its route only while its parent runtime lives. The root decision stays unchanged. Missing authorization or route metadata fails closed.

See [provider configuration](AGGREGATOR_ROUTING.md). Mixed-provider trees use stateless HTTP and full history replay; OpenRouter/Vercel routes need their deployment-owned secrets. Transport telemetry records outcomes, but unknown execution locations do not become regional performance evidence.

## Before-first-message command

In the managed `nanocodex2` terminal, use `/autoroute` (also listed in the `/` actions menu) before sending the first message. Like `/model`, it is unavailable once the thread starts, including when reopening an existing conversation. The command is a local UI action, not a message to the model. The UI waits for the API receipt before allowing submission, then Jev chooses and pins the provider/model from the first real task. Subagents continue to choose their own routes. New threads remain opt-in; this does not change a global preference.

For an already-created empty managed agent, `POST /v1/agents/{id}/routing` with no body or `{}` performs the same opt-in. It requires full account authority, the routing deployment gate and the AI binding. The server serializes it with settings changes and first-message admission, rejects retained history or previously accepted messages, and preserves unrelated configuration. Retrying an existing opt-in does not replace its route.

Native `nanocodex` does not yet have production integration for the managed provider router. Its `/autoroute` command explicitly reports that limitation and never claims to enable routing or submits the command as a prompt.

The model footer shows `Auto · choosing…` before selection, then the retained model, provider and effort. Child choices never replace the main-thread label. Read-only route metadata restores it on reconnect; a new manual thread returns to normal model defaults.


### Cloudflare frontier routes

A deployment can opt into Cloudflare's Astra, Sol, and Luna routes by setting `NANOCODEX_CLOUDFLARE_FRONTIER_ENABLED=true` with its AI binding configured and funded. Their candidate IDs are `cloudflare:openai/<canonical-model>:<low|medium|high>`, and the reported backend is `cloudflare`. Native Cloudflare GLM remains `workers_ai`. Missing/false preserves the prior candidate set; existing committed root and child routes never migrate. Individual threads still require the existing routing opt-in before their first message.

Cloudflare frontier calls use native Responses requests through the AI binding. They support portable tool/history replay and the same independently pinned subagent routing as the other gateways. Synthetic streaming probes use Responses events for generation TTFT; initial headers and creation events are not generated tokens. The existing probe schedule switch controls whether probes run. Unverified Cloudflare token pricing remains unknown rather than zero.
