# Explicit Claude JavaScript runtime

The additive `Claude.create` constructor runs the Rust Messages backend with the
**same** `nanocodex-durability` store, fencing, admission, effect receipts and
terminal replay machinery. It does not route through OpenAI Responses, launch
Claude Code, or install the Codex catalog.

`Agent.create({ harness: "claude", ...options })` also selects this native
backend in the Node, host, and browser SDKs. Browser mixed-family sessions run
in the calling isolate so their explicit tool handlers remain callable.

Enable the canonical task tree with `subagents: { maxConcurrency: 6 }` on a
Claude root. Supply `harnesses.codex` to grant that tree an explicit Responses
transport and tools. On a Codex root, supply `harnesses.claude` with explicit
Claude authentication and native tools. These capability recipes are ephemeral;
they cannot contain session IDs, durability, nested harnesses, or resume state.
Alternate Codex capabilities accept API and host-managed transports.

```js
import { Agent, Subagents, Transport } from "nanocodex/host";

const agent = await Agent.create({
  harness: "claude",
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  auth: { apiKey: anthropicKey },
  subagents: { maxConcurrency: 6 },
  harnesses: {
    codex: {
      transport: Transport.openAi({ apiKey: openAiKey, stateless: true }),
      model: "gpt-6.1-sol",
    },
  },
});
const child = await Subagents.spawn(agent, {
  harness: "codex", model: "sol", thinking: "low",
  role: "Reviewer", task: "Return a concise assessment.",
  outputSchema: { type: "string" },
});
const report = await Subagents.wait(agent, { agentIds: [child.agent_id] });
await agent.session.shutdown();
```

Both families use the same `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, messaging, result
submission, and subtree lifecycle. Model names belong to their selected family:
for example, `sol` selects Codex and `sonnet` selects Claude. Omitted family
inherits the parent; selecting another family uses that family's defaults.
Within a Claude tree, `{ model: "sonnet", ... }` selects Sonnet without repeating
`harness: "claude"`. `Subagents.spawnMany` inherits the parent's family, model
and thinking for the entire batch and rejects any overrides before admitting
children. Use `Subagents.spawn` to select a child's family or model explicitly.
Children retain their native transcripts and are reusable only while the root
runtime lives. A durable root's reopen does not recreate a child task tree.

Hosted managed threads retain their existing provider selection and Claude
`Task` capabilities; the explicit SDK recipes above do not configure hosted
account routing.

```js
import { Claude } from "nanocodex/node";
import { createMemoryDurabilityStore } from "nanocodex/durability";

const durabilityId = "claude-example";
const options = {
  model: "claude-sonnet-5",
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY },
  instructions: "Use the explicitly supplied tools. Preserve the result.",
  durability: createMemoryDurabilityStore(durabilityId),
  durabilityId,
  tools: [{
    name: "fixture_sum",
    description: "Add two integers.",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { a: { type: "integer" }, b: { type: "integer" } },
      required: ["a", "b"],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    handler: ({ a, b }, { sessionId, turnId, callId }) => {
      // Use these stable identities to reconcile external side effects.
      return String(a + b);
    },
  }],
};
const agent = await Claude.create(options);
const turn = agent.turn.prompt({ input: "Add 19 and 23.", id: "sum-request" });
await turn.accepted();
const result = await turn.result();
console.log(result.finalMessage);
result.dispose();
turn.dispose();
await agent.session.compact();
await agent.session.shutdown();

// Reattach auth and handlers, which are not serialized in checkpoints.
const reopened = await Claude.create(options);
const replay = reopened.turn.prompt({ input: "Add 19 and 23.", id: "sum-request" });
const replayResult = await replay.result();
console.log(replayResult.finalMessage);
replayResult.dispose();
replay.dispose();
await reopened.session.shutdown();
```

The example requires an explicitly authorized provider credential and model;
real provider execution and compaction may incur charges. The memory store
demonstrates handle reopen, not process-crash persistence. Use
a persistent existing `DurabilityStore` adapter for crash recovery. Terminal
replay requires the identical request ID **and input**. Changed input under an
existing ID is a conflict. An unfinished effect without a committed receipt
remains **at least once**; external hosts must deduplicate or reconcile
consequential actions. Dispatch is not proof of a committed result.

## Placement and authentication

Node executes WASM in the current process. Browser Claude executes in the
**current Web API isolate**, not the implicit module Worker created by Codex's
browser Agent. A caller-owned Worker can supply the WASM module explicitly.
Browser credentials remain accessible to that browser host: do not distribute
account-wide secrets to an untrusted frontend. The SDK does not install account sign-in UI. The managed platform adds private
subscription connection, authoritative model selection and egress around this same
WASM runtime; see [managed Claude](CLAUDE_MANAGED.md).

Supply exactly one `auth: { apiKey }` or `auth: { headers: async () => ({
authorization: "Bearer ..." }) }`. The callback owns authorized credential
acquisition, rotation and private storage. It resolves for outbound requests,
not terminal replay. This callback is **not** a JS PKCE login implementation and has no automatic
401-recovery callback; the host must supply a usable credential before dispatch.
Authentication failures are detail-free to avoid leaking credentials. Secrets
and handlers stay in host closures outside serialized config and checkpoints.

An explicit Messages `endpoint` may be supplied.
`compatibilityProfile: "subscription"` applies the measured public subscription
request profile to that endpoint; it neither grants subscription authority nor
borrows local Claude Code credentials. Fresh native OAuth login, live native
subscription admission and synthetic JS tests remain distinct. See
[authentication provenance](claude-authentication.md).

## Tools and lifecycle boundaries

Only the explicit Claude tool array is advertised. Explicit `strict` and
deferred-definition flags must be preserved or rejected, never silently ignored. No ambient workspace, shell,
web, MCP, Code Mode or subagent tools are installed. The injected handler owns
permission, isolation, resource bounds and external idempotency; stable call
identities and schema validation are not an OS sandbox. Thrown handler errors
become detail-free error results. Deliberate error output is tool-result data.

Prompt/Turn results, event watching, compaction and shutdown use the common JS
lifecycle. `agent.dispose()` detaches this client; already accepted work retains
its host/auth/store routes until terminal settlement, even without a caller
waiting for the result. `session.shutdown()` explicitly cancels and joins work.
Turn cancellation uses the actual Rust lifecycle identity, including anonymous
non-durable turns, rather than guessing from whichever turn is currently active.
A host abort signal is cooperative and is never proof an external effect was
rolled back; durable unknown outcomes still require reconciliation. Provider-native checkpoints are managed by the shared store, not
OpenAI `SessionSnapshot` objects. Durable Claude sessions expose
`session.document(key)`, `session.compareExchangeDocuments(writes)`,
`session.stageDocumentWrites(operationId, writes)` and
`session.documentFork(completedOperationId)`. Documents use conditional versions;
a transaction either publishes every write or leaves every value unchanged.
Staged writes publish with the successful operation's checkpoint and receipt.

A historical fork seed contains the original native Claude checkpoint, including
signed and opaque blocks, plus policy-selected session documents. Pass it as
`documentFork` to `Claude.create` with a fresh `durabilityId` and independently
supplied auth, tools and instructions. The destination must be pristine:

```js
const seed = await parent.session.documentFork("completed-turn-id");
const child = await Claude.create({
  auth, model: "claude-sonnet-4-6", tools, durability,
  durabilityId: "independent-child", documentFork: seed,
});
```

Document policies are `initial` (creation value), `current` (latest value),
`asOf` (value at the selected completed operation) and `block` (refuse a fork
when present in the source). An `asOf` document created after the selected
operation is omitted; `initial` and `current` follow their explicit source-value
policies. Historical boundaries survive terminal receipt pruning. Seeds
contain session data; credentials, grants, schedules and account-shared stores
must be supplied independently. Non-durable Codex `session.fork`, snapshot
export, runtime model switches and other OpenAI-specific operations still fail
explicitly. Whole-JSON checkpoint storage and complete host-tool/product parity
remain open limits.
