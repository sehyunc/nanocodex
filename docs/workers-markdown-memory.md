# Markdown memory on Cloudflare Workers

Managed agents can maintain `USER.md` for stable preferences, `MEMORY.md` for
curated durable facts and decisions, and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (optionally with
a lowercase slug) for working notes. The Markdown bodies are authoritative;
search is a derived index. This adapts the core file model from
[OpenClaw's memory design](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/concepts/memory.md)
to the existing authenticated MemoryScope Durable Object.

No sandbox, mounted filesystem, filesystem watcher, or native SQLite extension
is needed. The implementation uses Durable Object SQLite transactions and FTS5,
the existing `HISTORY_AI_SEARCH` binding for semantic retrieval, and the existing
`AI` binding for bounded extraction and consolidation.
Bodies, revisions, deletion tombstones, and index updates commit together. A
Worker restart does not lose files or an acknowledged append receipt.

## Tools and API

All memory tools use the `memories__*` namespace. The four pinned Codex tools
(`list`, `read`, `search`, `add_ad_hoc_note`) keep their input/output schemas.
The same `memories__read` and `memories__search` operations cover curated Markdown
and daily notes. Markdown adds only `memories__write` and `memories__status`.

`memories__read` accepts `path`, optional one-based `line_offset`, and `max_lines`.
`memories__search` accepts a `queries` array and Codex substring matching options,
and returns file/line matches. Semantic indexing is an internal retrieval facility;
it does not change the baseline Codex search contract. To save a note, provide
the operation, path, and content:

```json
{ "operation": "put", "path": "MEMORY.md", "content": "Use UTC for scheduled exports." }
```

Use `append` for daily notes and `delete` to remove a note. Read existing content
before replacing it. The model does not supply revisions or retry identifiers;
the host supplies delivery identity and storage commits each write atomically.
Internal consolidation still uses revision fences, and repeated delivery of the
same tool call reuses its stored result.

Authenticated POST endpoints are `/v1/memories/{list,read,search,add_ad_hoc_note,write,status}`.
Existing `/v1/markdown-memory/{get,search,write,status}` endpoints remain available
for older clients, including their optional explicit revision and delivery fields.

The configuration alias `memory` enables the complete namespace. Old `memory_*`
configuration entries resolve to the corresponding namespaced tools without
advertising duplicate tools. An empty tool configuration stays empty.

## Ownership and context

Direct account calls default to the authenticated user's private partition,
which follows that user across teams in the same organization. Connect calls
default to their authorized team and cannot select private memory. For direct
accounts, Codex file reads/searches access shared notes through the `team/` path
prefix. `write` and `status` accept `scope: "team"`. Shared writes require
`user_requested: true` and a user request to share that information; this flag is
an intent declaration, not a new source of authority. Every call still checks
live read/write capabilities. Subagents cannot mutate memory. Internal calls
carry the existing organization, team, subject, and private-owner assertions.

Normal and voice use the same already-prepared, scoped personalization snapshot.
The existing background refresh loads bounded curated/recent daily
Markdown excerpts (UTC today and yesterday). Admission does not await a
memory read, timeout, extraction, indexing pass, or consolidation job. A cache
miss starts the turn or voice session without memory; a background refresh can
make context available on later turns or through the active voice context channel.

Each Markdown scope contributes at most 12 KiB after serialization, with at most
4 KiB per file. Files are capped at 64 KiB and lines at 8 KiB. Codex reads retain
the upstream line-selection and truncation behavior. Prepared copies have bounded leases and are
invalidated in the background after Markdown edits. Recent changes may lag until
refresh or invalidation arrives. Expired copies are not injected; current user
corrections take precedence, and explicit tools can verify canonical memory.
Unchanged snapshots are not appended again to the same live agent session.

Saved prose is untrusted data, never instructions or permission. Voice lifecycle
replay projects only currently eligible prepared context, retaining scope and
authorization checks. Voice clients deliver prepared fields through the existing
background context channel, including after media connects. Large snapshots stay
out of the bounded SDP call request. Already delivered conversation content cannot
be erased.

Versioned legacy facts and their CRUD endpoints are retired. Activation removes
only legacy fact/scan tables and invalidates old fact-bearing prepared bodies.
Canonical Markdown, append-only Codex notes, history, and prepared Markdown
context remain. Private notes are never reclassified as team knowledge.

## Semantic retrieval

Every canonical edit atomically enqueues immutable revision/chunk projections.
Durable Object alarms drain bounded batches into AI Search. Provider responses
supply candidate identities; returned text is always rehydrated from live,
authorized SQLite rows after the request finishes. Stale revisions, deleted
notes and foreign owner metadata cannot become recall results. Lexical search
continues when the binding is missing, unavailable or times out; responses report
that fallback rather than claiming semantic retrieval worked.

Hybrid search uses reciprocal rank fusion, recency decay for dated notes and
MMR diversity. Evergreen curated files do not decay. Index retry state survives
eviction. Deletion is immediately effective in canonical reads and recall,
while remote index cleanup is asynchronous and visible in `memories__status`.
Index operations have durable 30-second leases and a 16-attempt budget; deletion
reconciliation stops after a 15-minute horizon. Exhausted/expired receipts remain
visible instead of keeping an alarm alive forever. A new canonical revision
queues new indexing work. Late upload completion reopens deletion work, but
physical removal from the remote index is not claimed until cleanup succeeds.
`DREAMS.md` is readable explicitly but excluded from search and bootstrap.

## Compaction is independent of memory

Managed sessions do not invoke memory extraction before compaction and do not
require a memory receipt to continue. Memory inference failures cannot block
compaction or fail a conversation. Agents save useful context explicitly with
`memories__write` during their work. Existing durable conversation records remain
available independently of compaction. The old extraction endpoint has no
production trigger; this implementation does not claim automatic extraction from
every retained conversation. Saved-note consolidation runs in the background.

## Background consolidation

Daily writes queue optional consolidation for the next UTC day. A queue or alarm
scheduling failure does not reject the saved note. Alarms process bounded source batches using a tool-free Workers AI completion. Every selected
candidate must match exact source lines and revisions; generated prose cannot
invent a new fact. The pass may add, merge or supersede its own attributed
entries in `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md`, preserving unrelated manual curation.

Revision checks reject stale proposals after concurrent edits or deletion. Appends
and edits outside cited lines preserve entries whose evidence is unchanged;
corrections and deletions retract affected generated entries. Manual curation
fences in-flight proposals while preserving unrelated pending sources and the
daily model budget. Removing an attributed entry excludes its cited lines from pending work while
preserving the other lines in the same daily file. Provenance supports audit, and source edits clear retained
preimages. Explicit recall markers and consolidation reports are excluded from
automatic promotion, and identical evidence is deduplicated.

Canonical reads and background consolidation proceed independently of remote
personalization-cache invalidation failures. Markdown changes invalidate prepared
copies in the background.
`DREAMS.md` records bounded outcomes without being fed back into retrieval.
Model attempts and retry leases are bounded and persist across eviction.
Extraction permits 48 inference attempts per owner per UTC day. Consolidation
permits three attempts per owner per UTC day, selects at most eight sources and
12 KiB per batch, and retains 32 audit receipts with their preimages. Both passes
limit model output to 2,048 tokens. These are ceilings, not usage targets.

`memories__status` (and its authenticated HTTP endpoint) exposes semantic backlog,
consolidation work and receipts, and extraction receipts without invoking a
model. `NANOCODEX_MEMORY_AUTOMATION=false` disables automatic extraction and
consolidation while retaining authored Markdown and search. The configured
Workers AI model is `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`; automatic passes
consume Workers AI usage within the enforced per-owner budgets. Existing
Cloudflare bindings are reused; no local daemon or additional resource is
required.

## References and limits

This is a Workers adaptation of the requested Markdown, hybrid retrieval,
and consolidation behavior. It is not a claim of exact
OpenClaw scheduler or model parity. See OpenClaw's
[memory search](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory-search) and
[dreaming](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/dreaming) designs. Automatic extraction
and consolidation are conservative and bounded; explicit memory saves remain
useful for technical progress not present as firsthand user statements.

Muse motivated the requested behavior. Meta's [personal Muse design](https://introducing.muse.ai/)
describes a persistent main conversation and side chats; its memory internals
are not public. Separately, [Muse Code configuration](https://dev.meta.ai/docs/muse-code/configuration)
documents compact MEMORY.md bootstrap and on-demand topic retrieval. These are
product references, not evidence that both products share an implementation.
The linked OpenClaw source and Nanocodex's authorization/storage contracts are
the implementation basis.
