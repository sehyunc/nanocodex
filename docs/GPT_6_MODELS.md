# GPT-6 model integration

The supported OpenAI models are `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6.1-sol`, and `gpt-6-luna`.
The `astra`, `sol`, and `luna` aliases resolve to those IDs. GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra,
and Luna are not selectable models. Astra remains the default. Model selection
is fixed for an active conversation; existing provider checkpoints must not be
reused under another model. Retired model IDs remain intact in stored settings;
resuming a retired snapshot or rollout fails explicitly instead of switching models.

## Upstream contract

The Luna integration follows the Codex
[launch commit](https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b),
including its
[model catalog](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json),
[picker snapshot](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b/codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/snapshots/codex_tui__chatwidget__tests__model_selection_popup.snap),
and [catalog tests](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b/codex-rs/tui/src/app/tests/model_catalog.rs).
Sol follows the [GPT-6.1 Sol upstream revision](https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/5937592c07e7321f6b0469ef34dd58a03c39a84c)
and its [model catalog](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/5937592c07e7321f6b0469ef34dd58a03c39a84c/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json).
The corresponding [catalog implementation](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/5937592c07e7321f6b0469ef34dd58a03c39a84c/codex-rs/models-manager/src/manager.rs)
and [catalog tests](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/5937592c07e7321f6b0469ef34dd58a03c39a84c/codex-rs/models-manager/src/manager_tests.rs)
define upstream model discovery; Nanocodex consumes the pinned Sol entry.
Sol and Luna each use an exact copy of their own upstream instruction template.
The [prompt manifest](../scripts/codex-parity/prompts.json) records their source
and hashes. Astra and the permission, voice, and goal prompts remain pinned to
`36430b36881cf5c289cb48e671cfc9e8b542ae7b`; Luna uses the launch pin.
Caller-supplied replacement and additive instructions remain supported.

The SDK model defaults are low effort for Astra and Sol and medium for Luna,
following the Codex catalog. The public GPT-6.1 Sol API defaults to medium effort.
The `nanocodex` and `nanocodex2` CLIs default to Sol with xhigh effort and fast
mode enabled. Explicit caller effort wins. The public effort range ends at `max`;
Codex's Sol `ultra` mode requires orchestration beyond this model integration.
GPT-6.1 Sol supports `low` through `max` and rejects `none` and `minimal`, as specified by the official
[Sol model contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6.1-sol).
Luna also supports `none` under its
[model contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-luna).
Sol and Luna support standard and Pro reasoning independently of effort, following
the [reasoning-mode contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning#reasoning-mode).

The API context window is 1,050,000 tokens with up to 128,000 output tokens.
Nanocodex uses Codex's 272,000-token default prompt context and configurable
872,000-token maximum. Existing provider compaction manages retained context.

Responses Lite uses local Code Mode, all-turn reasoning context, and
`parallel_tool_calls: false`. Its image inputs omit `detail`, following
[upstream request construction](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b/codex-rs/core/src/client.rs#L859-L1002)
and [image normalization tests](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/49e95cc73f4eb2999b1d14f863c009168df6122b/codex-rs/core/tests/suite/responses_lite.rs#L264-L335).
Nanocodex owns its execution tools, subagent lifecycle, and static model policy.
Upstream's dynamic catalog, Node REPL approval system, and model migration UI
are outside these contracts.

## Astra protocol boundaries

Astra accepts `low` through `max` effort, but rejects `none` and Pro mode;
requests omit `reasoning.mode`. `ToolDefinition::with_async_execution()` marks
application-owned async tools, whose jobs and original `call_id` remain the
application's responsibility. Managed tools do not enable this automatically.
Steering is applied at model-call boundaries, not through `response.steer`.
Nanocodex enables codex-rs's cache-preserving reasoning-effort update path for
GPT-6 Astra and GPT-6.1 Sol, whose pinned model catalog advertises support.
The agent pins the request-level `reasoning.effort` for the surviving context.
When the selected effort changes, it appends a trusted `configuration_update`
item after the new user input. It does not replace earlier instructions or
rewrite the existing prefix. An effort-only change keeps the same request
baseline, prompt cache key, and healthy previous-response continuation.
Unchanged selections do not add redundant updates.

The pin and authored-update provenance survive agent checkpoints and recovery.
Compaction uses the surviving baseline; failed compaction leaves it intact.
Successful compaction retires the old updates and lets the next model request
establish the currently selected effort as its new baseline. A stable prefix
preserves the opportunity for provider cache reuse; it does not guarantee a
cache hit.

Luna and gateway models retain request-level effort changes. Their outgoing
requests filter saved configuration updates without removing the stored items.
Fast mode remains a separate service-tier setting: changing it replays retained
history because the request envelope changed. Active and already accepted turns
keep their captured settings. `misalignment_policy_violation` is terminal and
does not retry or roll back earlier external actions.

## Gateway transports

The SDK gateway adapter accepts Sol efforts from `low` through `max` and Luna
efforts from `none` through `max`. Cloudflare Responses preserves explicit
standard/Pro mode; Chat Completions gateways reject
Pro instead of silently dropping it. GPT-6.1 Sol tool calling requires Responses;
Chat Completions supports Sol without tools. Luna tool calling through Chat
Completions requires `none` effort. Managed tool-capable routing therefore offers
Sol and Luna only through native ChatGPT and Cloudflare Responses. Retired GPT-5.6 IDs
remain rejected.

## Costs and service tier

Fast mode sends `service_tier: "priority"`; disabling it omits `service_tier`,
matching [codex-rs request normalization](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/822e58cc3d666166c7446c5b1ea2e52f5d09594c/codex-rs/protocol/src/openai_models.rs#L988-L1003).
The selected mode remains explicit in session settings. It does not change the
reasoning effort, reasoning context, or system/developer instructions.

[Official pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing), per million
tokens at standard short-context rates:

| Model | Input | Cached input | Cache write | Output |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Astra | $10 | $1 | $12.50 | $50 |
| Sol | $2 | $0.10 | $2.50 | $10 |
| Luna | $0.10 | $0.01 | $0.125 | $0.50 |

Above 272,000 input tokens, the whole request uses twice the input and cache
rates and 1.5 times the output rate. Fast mode doubles those applicable rates.
Provider-reported usage drives result and trace estimates. API-equivalent
subscription estimates are not subscription charges. Historical measurements
retain their original model IDs and do not establish GPT-6.1 Sol performance.

## Live validation

Local subscription-authenticated SDK checks on September 22, 2026 completed tool
calls and follow-on turns for Astra, GPT-6 Sol, and Luna, retained each requested model
in snapshots, and reported `estimated_from_usage` costs at their configured rates.
GPT-6 Sol and Luna also completed those checks with `none` effort. These checks
precede GPT-6.1 Sol.

The ChatGPT endpoint rejected Pro requests for GPT-6 Sol and Luna with
`unsupported_value` on `reasoning.mode`. The public Responses API documentation
lists Pro support; this subscription endpoint result does not establish API-key
availability. Nanocodex preserves the explicit API setting and surfaces provider
rejections without changing the requested mode or model.

On September 29, 2026, the rebuilt Node/WASM SDK rejected `gpt-6-sol` and
GPT-6.1 Sol with `none` effort before transport. A GPT-6.1 Sol tool-turn request
at low effort reached the ChatGPT endpoint, which returned HTTP 400:
"The 'gpt-6.1-sol' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."
The available account could not complete a live tool call or follow-on turn.
API-key access was not configured for this run. Provider errors remain visible;
Nanocodex does not substitute another model.
