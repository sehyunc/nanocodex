# Managed login and hosted connections

This document is the canonical design for the first-party interactive
`nanocodex login` and `nanocodex connect` flows. Agents changing CLI login,
Nanocodex Connect, Accounts device authorization, hosted-agent grants, or
connection onboarding must read it before editing those surfaces.

## Product contract

The commands are:

```text
nanocodex login
nanocodex connect <chatgpt|github|gmail|gdrive|x>...
```

"Login" means creating or signing into a Nanocodex account and authorizing this
Nanocodex installation. It does not mean logging directly into ChatGPT.
It requests the base hosted-agent, history, and memory capabilities only.

"Connect" means connecting one or more named hosted services and attaching them
to this installation. It may reuse an existing browser account session, but it
still uses an explicit installation authorization: selecting an account in the
browser does not itself grant the CLI access. Each request grants exactly the connectors
named on that command line; it never inherits hidden connector requirements from
an earlier account or installation grant.

The Account page is the persistent catalog for connecting, disconnecting, and
inspecting services independently of a CLI request. A CLI connect page is the
focused form of the same UI and shows only the connector named by the signed
request.

Figma is available in the account catalog as an **Add connection** preset for
`https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`. Add it, then choose **Connect** on the new Figma row
to authorize through the existing remote MCP OAuth flow. Connected rows support
**Revoke**; expired authorization uses **Reconnect**. Adding a connection does
not grant an installation access automatically. Use `nanocodex connect figma`
(or `nanocodex connect mcp.figma.com`) to authorize Figma for an installation.
Creation and OAuth failures leave the existing retry controls available.

[Figma's remote server documentation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/remote-server-installation/)
requires Figma OAuth and says clients must be approved in its MCP catalog.
Provider approval failures are reported through the existing MCP error flow;
adding this preset does not bypass Figma's client approval policy.

The interactive CLI receives a scoped Nanocodex Connect grant. It must not
silently mint a general-purpose Nanocodex API key. API keys remain an explicit
operation for CI, curl, or another machine.

The device envelope still uses Tempo Accounts/Wata `wallet_connect`; this is an
RPC transport name, not the login mechanism. Nanocodex account login is a
first-party SMS OTP flow owned by the managed Cloudflare Worker. For a
persistent SMS account, the root signer is the account's custodial Worker-owned
wallet, not a browser wallet.

## End-to-end flow

1. **Choose one action.** `nanocodex login` requests the base installation
   grant. `nanocodex connect <service>...` requests exactly the named connectors.
   One service is focused and starts automatically; multiple services stay
   explicit so the user chooses each connection action.

2. **Check the existing login.** Login loads its local Nanocodex login record.
   If its base grant is valid, it reports the account, hosted agent, expiry, and
   capabilities instead of starting a redundant ceremony. Connect deliberately
   starts a new ceremony because it changes the installation grant.

3. **Prepare the requested authorization.** A non-MPP request includes
   `urn:nanocodex:authorization:hosted`, allowing Connect to approve hosted
   authority without returning or persisting a key. An explicit MPP request is
   a separate access-key ceremony: it omits this marker, prepares a delegated
   Tempo access key, and requires the Worker-root-signed access-key result. The
   delegated key may be returned to the installation; the root key never is.

4. **Register a device authorization.** The CLI starts a Wata device-code
   exchange containing one `wallet_connect` RPC request. The request declares
   the exact capabilities this installation wants:

   - run a hosted Nanocodex agent;
   - read hosted conversation history;
   - use hosted durable memory;
   - for `connect`, grant exactly the connector services selected in the command;
   - optionally use MPP under an explicit access-key spending policy.

   A connect request also signs a singular connector-focus resource. The focus
   must be part of the exact signed connector set.

5. **Open Nanocodex Connect.** The device-code host returns a user code and
   verification URL. The CLI prints both and opens the verification URL in the
   browser when possible. `--no-open` suppresses only that automatic launch.

6. **Establish the Nanocodex account.** The user enters an E.164 phone number
   and a six-digit code delivered by Twilio Verify over SMS or eligible RCS.
   Verify generates and checks the code. The managed Worker binds only an HMAC
   digest of the phone to the account and provisions the persistent account's
   root wallet through private egress before issuing the same HttpOnly account
   session used by managed agents. Wallet provisioning is idempotent and a
   failure leaves the local challenge retryable. A new phone promotes only the
   current anonymous browser account; a known phone restores its existing
   agents, memory, connections, and wallet address.

7. **Run the focused action.** The browser derives its work from the signed
   `wallet_connect` request:

   - login requests installation access and no connector catalog;
   - connect shows only the focused service;
   - an already connected focused service needs no redundant OAuth ceremony;
   - show access-key limits, expiry, scopes, and funding policy when MPP is
     requested;
   - show history and memory access as permissions, without inventing an
     external login step for them.

   The persistent Account page remains available as the complete service
   catalog.

   A focused CLI connection stays in the current browser tab. OAuth services
   navigate that tab to the provider and return through the fixed callback
   relay to a compact connected/not-connected result page. The embedded
   `/connect-dialog` surface may use its own dialog behavior; it is not the CLI
   device flow.

8. **Approve the installation automatically.** Once the SMS-backed account is
   established, the device wizard submits the exact pending hosted
   installation request without a separate account-card or approval click.
   SMS verification, provider OAuth, and MPP policy remain interactive when
   they genuinely require user input. The
   final browser view is the completed installation CTA. The embedded
   `/connect-dialog` approval remains explicit.

9. **Return the explicit Accounts result.** For access-key mode, Nanocodex
   Connect asks the account-authenticated managed Worker to sign the exact
   `wallet_connect` request; egress uses the account root and returns only a
   sanitized result. Nanocodex Connect submits the approved result to the Wata
   device-code host. The CLI polls with PKCE
   and receives exactly one account. The result is either the existing signed
   access-key authorization or a hosted authorization containing a 43-character
   one-time approval identifier and `mode: "hosted"`. The CLI accepts hosted
   mode only for a non-MPP request carrying the hosted resource marker.
   Provider credentials are never returned to the CLI.

10. **Create the Nanocodex Connect grant.** The CLI exchanges the approval with
    the Connect API using an explicit `authorization_mode`. `access_key` sends
    the existing key authorization fields. `hosted` sends the app, account,
    approval, permission, and requested connectors with no access-key material.
    The platform validates the account link, resources, connector readiness,
    and authorization policy; creates or reuses the user's hosted agent and
    private egress subject; and returns a response with the same mode, a scoped
    grant token, agent identifier, exact capabilities, and bounded expiry.

11. **Persist the login locally.** Owner-only `connect.json` retains the scoped
    grant token, account and agent identifiers, expiry, approved capabilities,
    and an access-key identifier only for access-key mode. Hosted mode writes no
    Tempo key. Rotation and logout retire a local Tempo key only when the stored
    mode has one. Neither mode retains ChatGPT, OpenAI, or connector credentials
    received from the platform.

12. **Report the resulting state.** The command ends with a stable summary, for
    example:

    ```text
    Logged in to Nanocodex

    Account       c884e3c5…480e
    Hosted agent  agent_…
    ChatGPT       connected
    History       enabled
    Memory        enabled
    GitHub        not requested
    Grant expires Sep 25, 2026
    ```

## Capability and storage boundaries

- The managed Cloudflare Worker owns HMAC phone identity,
  browser-bound challenges, account sessions, and the one-time hosted
  authorization. Twilio Verify owns OTP generation, delivery, attempt limits,
  expiry, and checking. Tempo Accounts/Wata owns the device-code transport and
  PKCE exchange. The private egress broker owns persistent SMS-account root
  wallets and signs only bounded `wallet_connect` access-key authorizations and
  `wallet_revokeAccessKey` operations.
- The Worker retains each browser challenge for five minutes. SMS starts have no
  local resend delay or per-phone/IP request caps; `resend_after` is zero.
  The Verify Service must use six-digit codes with a validity window compatible
  with that local lifetime. The Worker stores only keyed HMAC phone digests and
  opaque Verify identifiers; it never stores an OTP.
- Nanocodex Connect owns the application identity, requested Nanocodex
  resources, account linking, connector onboarding, consent UI, and scoped
  grant.
- The private egress broker exclusively owns hosted ChatGPT, OpenAI, and other
  provider credentials and persistent account root private keys. Agent actors
  and CLI clients retain only opaque subjects, scoped grants, and delegated
  access keys. Root keys and their encrypted envelopes never leave egress.
- Root wallets use the existing `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` envelope in the
  account's per-user Durable Object. This is custodial server-side encryption,
  not user-held end-to-end encryption. Configurable-account migration is future
  work; see [the custody contract](WALLET_CUSTODY.md).
- A local ChatGPT credential is never uploaded implicitly. In local
  development, `nanocodex connect chatgpt` is the explicit user-approved action
  that claims an available local Codex/ChatGPT credential into the broker when
  that account does not already have ChatGPT connected. The credential remains
  broker-owned and is never returned to the browser or CLI grant.
- Durable memory is always hosted and account/team scoped. There is no local
  durable-memory store to merge with it.
- Hosted history is account/team scoped. A consumer may separately search local
  session history, but that is a retrieval concern after login, not part of the
  account or credential ceremony.
- Interactive logout revokes or discards the scoped grant and removes local
  installation secrets. It must not disconnect the user's hosted connectors or
  delete their Nanocodex account unless explicitly requested.
- A connector is an account credential boundary, not automatically an MCP
  server. MCP-native services may attach a concrete MCP transport. ChatGPT,
  GitHub, Gmail, Drive, and X continue to use their native broker/API adapters
  unless the product deliberately assigns an MCP endpoint to one of them.
- A remote OAuth MCP is represented by a broker-generated opaque connection ID.
  `nanocodex connect mcp.linear.app` authorizes that exact ID, while the endpoint,
  OAuth registration, PKCE material, and provider tokens remain broker-private.
  Native agents attach the ID through the grant-scoped Connect proxy and expose
  its tools through the existing deferred `tool_search` path.

## Browser behavior

The browser should compute steps from requested capabilities and current
account state. Examples:

| Entry point | Browser work |
| --- | --- |
| Account page | Show the complete connector and API-key catalog |
| `nanocodex login` | Select/create an account and authorize the installation |
| `nanocodex connect chatgpt` | Show only the ChatGPT connection action |
| `nanocodex connect github` | Show only the GitHub connection action |
| `nanocodex connect chatgpt github ...` | Show every requested connector with no automatic selection |
| `nanocodex connect mcp.linear.app` | Authorize the focused remote MCP in the same tab, then settle when connected |
| `nanocodex connect mcp.linear.app github ...` | Show every requested connector/MCP with no automatic selection |
| Other single `connect` services | Show only the corresponding connector action |
| Any request with MPP | Show the local access-key expiry, scopes, and limits |

Once account identity, connector readiness, and policy review are satisfied,
the browser settles immediately. It must not add a second generic Continue
step.

### Explicit ChatGPT credential import

`nanocodex connect chatgpt` imports the currently configured Codex ChatGPT
login only as part of that explicit approval ceremony. `--auth-file` may
override the source for a request that includes ChatGPT; otherwise the CLI uses
`NANOCODEX_AUTH_FILE`, `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, or `~/.codex/auth.json` in that
order. Plain `nanocodex login` and every connect request that omits ChatGPT must
not resolve or open the Codex auth file.

Before device registration, the CLI opens the file once without following its
final symlink where the platform supports that protection. It accepts only a
regular file owned by the current user, inaccessible to group and other Unix
users, and no larger than 64 KiB. The document must be a ChatGPT-mode Codex
login with bounded ID and access JWTs and a bounded refresh token. The ID and
access JWT account and FedRAMP claims must agree with the stored account ID. The
refresh token is an opaque value: it must be nonblank and control-free, but is
not decoded as a JWT. The access expiry must be more than five minutes in the
future.

The signed `wallet_connect` resources contain exactly one import commitment:

```text
urn:nanocodex:credential-import:chatgpt:codex-auth-v1:sha256:<base64url-sha256>
```

The digest input is the bytes
`nanocodex/chatgpt-credential-import/v1\0`, followed in order by the access
token, refresh token, and account ID, each encoded as a big-endian `u32` UTF-8
byte length and the UTF-8 bytes, then the expiry in Unix epoch milliseconds as
a big-endian `u64`, then one FedRAMP byte (`0` or `1`). After the wallet result
has been validated, `/v1/connections` receives `chatgpt_credential_import` with
exactly `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `account_id`, `expires_at`, and
`fedramp`. These credentials are ephemeral request material and are never
written to `connect.json` or returned in CLI diagnostics.

### Explicit SSH private-key import

The legacy CLI can import one existing SSH identity into the account Vault:

```sh
nanocodex connect ssh --key-file /path/to/key.pem --reference my-server \
  --hostname server.example.com --port 22 --username deploy \
  --host-key-sha256 'SHA256:<unpadded-base64-fingerprint>'
```

All six SSH options require the `ssh` target; port defaults to 22. The CLI
validates the reference, canonical public lowercase DNS/IPv4 host, username,
port, and host-key fingerprint before reading the file. References start with
an alphanumeric character, contain at most 64 letters, digits, dots,
underscores or hyphens, and cannot use reserved object-property names. Pins
use the canonical unpadded `SHA256:` form. Encoded target resources must fit
within 512 bytes. Private, loopback, link-local and local-only targets are
rejected under the same destination policy as the Connect API.

The key file must be a regular non-symlink file no larger than 64 KiB. The CLI
opens and reads it once, with final-component no-follow protection on Unix
and Windows. It checks the PEM envelope and DER structure for unencrypted RSA
PKCS1, NIST P-256/P-384/P-521 EC SEC1, or RSA/EC PKCS8 keys. OpenSSH,
encrypted, malformed and other key formats are rejected locally. Extra
whitespace around the PEM envelope is rejected. These local checks validate
the supported encoding; the broker performs cryptographic key import.

The approval displays the SSH reference, host, port, username and host-key pin.
Its signed resources contain one commitment and one target descriptor:

```text
urn:nanocodex:credential-import:ssh:pem-v1:sha256:<base64url-sha256>
urn:nanocodex:ssh-target:<reference>:<hostname>:<port>:<username>:<host-key-sha256>
```

Each text component in the target uses JavaScript `encodeURIComponent`
encoding. The commitment hashes UTF-8 `nanocodex/ssh-credential-import/v1\0`,
then reference, hostname, username, host-key fingerprint and exact PEM, each
with a big-endian `u32` UTF-8 length followed by its bytes, then the port as a
big-endian `u32`. Only after approval does the CLI post the six-field
`ssh_credential_import` object to the pinned Connect origin. The PEM never
enters browser resources, prompts, local grant storage or diagnostics.

Existing connector/MCP grants are preserved. SSH is a separate Connect target,
not a service connector or generic API-key update. Fresh SSH and ChatGPT
imports require separate commands. An ambiguous or rejected SSH connection
POST is never automatically repeated, including transport retries; check the
account's saved identity status before starting another import.

The executable regression journey is
`node bin/nanocodex/tests/ssh_import_cli_e2e.mjs /absolute/path/to/nanocodex`.
It generates synthetic keys and uses only a local HTTP approval fixture.
