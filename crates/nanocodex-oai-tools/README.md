# Nanocodex OpenAI Tools

Tool building blocks for `OpenAI` agents.

`nanocodex-oai-tools` is useful without the Nanocodex agent loop. It provides the
caller-defined [`Tool`] contract, `tool` macro, heterogeneous [`Tools`]
registry, Code Mode runtime, standard workspace tools, and native MCP clients.
The OpenAI-specific contract types are defined by `nanocodex-oai-api` and re-exported
here so a tool implementation has one import surface.

Claude-native adapters live in the independent `nanocodex-claude-tools` crate.
They do not depend on this runtime or its Responses contracts. The Rust crate
rename does not rename the JavaScript/npm package `nanocodex-tools`.

## Define and select tools

The definition is the single source of truth for a tool's registry name. The
macro derives its input and output schemas from the function:

```rust
use nanocodex_oai_tools::{Tools, tool};

#[tool(
    name = "deployment_region",
    description = "Return the production region for a named service.",
    parallel = true
)]
async fn deployment_region(service: String) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    Ok(format!("{service}: us-west-2"))
}

# fn build() -> Result<(), nanocodex_oai_tools::ToolsBuildError> {
let tools = Tools::builder()
    .without_defaults()
    .tool(deployment_region)
    .build()?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

`Tools` defaults to `ToolExposure::CodeModeOnly`, where ordinary tools are
available through `exec` and only Code Mode entrypoints are directly visible.
Select `ToolExposure::DirectAndCodeMode` when a consumer needs the same
ordinary tools directly as well as through `exec`:

```rust
use nanocodex_oai_tools::{ToolExposure, Tools};

# fn build() -> Result<(), nanocodex_oai_tools::ToolsBuildError> {
let tools = Tools::builder()
    .exposure(ToolExposure::DirectAndCodeMode)
    .build()?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Matching Codex, direct-plus-Code-Mode exposure keeps `exec` terse and
adds each typed `exec` declaration to the corresponding direct tool; Code
Mode-only instead carries the complete nested catalog in `exec`. Selection
changes model-visible exposure, not registration or dispatch behavior.
`tool_with_exposure` can override one registered tool with `DirectOnly`,
`CodeModeOnly`, `DirectAndCodeMode`, or `Hidden` while preserving the global
default for the rest. Host-owned `exec`, `wait`, and `tool_search` names cannot
be replaced, and colliding normalized JavaScript names are rejected when the
recipe is built.

`ToolsBuilder::add` composes the same recipe from a fixed [`Tool`], a
[`WorkspaceTools`] value, or [`Mcp`](mcp::Mcp). A workspace source selects canonical
local workspace tools rooted at its directory; adding a second workspace source
is rejected.
Namespaced Code Mode names such as `image_gen__imagegen` remain available to
`exec`; normal Code Mode exposes the Codex-compatible `image_gen.imagegen`
Responses namespace and routes its namespaced call to the same handler.

Tools execute concurrently. The `parallel` declaration remains provider
metadata; the runtime does not use it to serialize calls. Await dependent calls
explicitly in Code Mode and handle conflicts reported by the provider.

Implement [`Tool`] directly when execution needs [`ToolContext`], freeform
input, multimodal [`ToolOutput`], or a custom definition:

```rust
use nanocodex_oai_tools::{
    Tool, ToolContext, ToolDefinition, ToolInput, ToolOutput, ToolResult,
    contract::async_trait,
};
use serde_json::json;

struct DeploymentRegion;

#[async_trait]
impl Tool for DeploymentRegion {
    fn definition(&self) -> ToolDefinition {
        ToolDefinition::function(
            "deployment_region",
            "Return the production region for a named service.",
            json!({
                "type": "object",
                "properties": { "service": { "type": "string" } },
                "required": ["service"],
                "additionalProperties": false
            }),
        )
    }

    async fn execute(
        &self,
        input: ToolInput,
        _context: ToolContext<'_>,
    ) -> ToolResult {
        let input: serde_json::Value = input.decode_json()?;
        let service = input["service"].as_str().ok_or_else(|| {
            std::io::Error::new(
                std::io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput,
                "service must be a string",
            )
        })?;
        Ok(ToolOutput::text(format!("{service}: us-west-2")))
    }
}
```

## Embed Code Mode in another host

[`embedded`] is the portable boundary for environments that own JavaScript
execution outside Rust. Build the ordinary [`Tools`] recipe, implement
[`embedded::CodeModeHost`], and bind that host at the embedding boundary. The
adapter reuses the same execution, nested-call, notification, observer, and
owned-context types as native Code Mode. The [`embedded`] module documentation
includes a complete host implementation.

## MCP

MCP is the `mcp` feature, part of the default `native`. Native consumers
configure stdio or Streamable HTTP servers and install the provider into the same registry:

```rust
use nanocodex_oai_tools::{
    Tools,
    mcp::{Mcp, McpServer},
};

# fn build() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mcp = Mcp::builder()
    .server(
        "company_docs",
        McpServer::stdio("company-docs-mcp").arg("--readonly"),
    )
    .build()?;

let tools = Tools::builder().add(mcp).build()?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Handshakes and discovery start with the owning runtime. Both exposure policies
keep the provider-native `tool_search` visible while omitting deferred MCP
schemas from the initial request. Code Mode lists those deferred tools as
compact name/description entries in `ALL_TOOLS`. Search results contain loadable
MCP namespaces for direct model calls and also activate matching Code Mode
definitions, keeping large catalogs out of the initial tool list.
`McpServer::tool_exposure` independently selects `DeferredOnly`,
`CodeModeOnly`, `DeferredAndCodeMode`, or `Hidden` for each server. Automatic
catalog pagination is bounded by page, item, cursor, and wall-clock limits.

## Attach one immutable recipe

With the `attachment` feature, the same `Tools` value can execute behind a
reverse WebSocket. Attachment consumes the complete recipe, finishes MCP
discovery, validates the immutable catalog, connects, and waits for the remote
catalog acknowledgement:

```rust,no_run
use nanocodex_oai_tools::{Tools, attachment::AttachmentTarget};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let tools = Tools::builder().without_defaults().build()?;
let target = AttachmentTarget::new("wss://tools.example.test/v1/attach", "bearer")?;
let (attachment, mut events) = tools.attach(target).connect().await?;

let observer = tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(event) = events.recv().await {
        println!("{event:?}");
    }
});
attachment.detach().await?;
observer.await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Workspace attachments dispatch calls concurrently, including patches and tools
whose provider metadata declares them nonparallel. The attached
`exec_command` call has a 40-second deadline and `write_stdin` a 310-second
deadline, including queueing and cleanup. These bounds cover their maximum
30-second execution yield and 300-second process poll with transport grace;
longer processes return retained session IDs for later polling. A deadline
after execution starts reports an uncertain outcome rather than resending the
command.

`AttachmentStatus::Ready` means the remote acknowledged the catalog. Tool
responsiveness is established by call results. Transport failures reconnect
with backoff while the same runtime retains its processes and command journal.
WebSocket control ping/pong detects a lost transport without application
heartbeat messages. Completed results remain in the journal until the broker
acknowledges them; reconnecting resends receipts and reconciles running command
IDs without executing commands again. The admitted deadline still bounds each
call. A different executor runtime cannot recover an old command's execution
proof, so that outcome remains uncertain. Terminal cleanup publishes
`Disconnected`, or `Fenced` for authentication and policy rejection, before
`closed()` resolves.

Only sources with a concrete attached executor are accepted: fixed tools,
MCP added with `add`, and pinned `WorkspaceTools`. Generic dynamic providers
remain local-only. Built-in web search and image generation also remain at the
model backend, so attached recipes disable defaults and opt into concrete
sources. Preparation and discovery errors happen before a socket is opened;
`connect` returns only after readiness. The cheap `Attachment` control handle
is cloneable and its last drop detaches. `AttachmentEvents` is an independent,
bounded, best-effort observer: lag may drop events but can never delay tool
execution or protocol progress. `Attachment::status` and `closed` are the
authoritative lifecycle APIs.

### Deferred: workspace replication

Attachment chooses where a tool call executes; it does not move or merge
workspace data. An attached local workspace and the detached cloud
`/workspace` may therefore diverge. Automatic replication and reconciliation
are intentionally deferred to a separate capability with explicit direction,
conflict, and recovery policy. Until that capability exists, attach and detach
must never imply synchronization.

## Companion workspace runtimes

The default `native` feature remains the complete tools crate: registry, Code
Mode, MCP, web/image tools, macros, and standard workspace tools: `code-mode`
(everything the agent loop needs) plus `mcp` (MCP, OAuth, deferred-tool search).

The narrower `workspace-runtime` feature exists only for process companions
such as `nanocodex-vm-guest`. With default features disabled, it exposes the
canonical [`workspace_runtime::WorkspaceToolRuntime`], standard tool
identities, and their shared contracts without linking OpenAI transports, Code
Mode/QuickJS, MCP, or HTTP clients. This is artifact separation, not a second
tool implementation or an alternate mode for normal native applications.

The `image-processing` feature exposes the shared bounded image decoder in
[`image`] without a tool runtime, for provider adapters that prepare images
outside Code Mode.

Both runtimes retain yielded shell sessions until their exit is collected or
the owner cancels or shuts down the runtime. Opening another command never
evicts an existing process, and there is no application-level process-count
cap. The host operating system remains responsible for resource limits.

## Going lower level

The crate root intentionally contains only the normal registry path:
[`Tools`], `ToolsBuilder`, `ToolsBuildError`, [`Tool`], `tool`, and the types
required by the `Tool` methods. [`ToolExposure`] is the advanced declaration
policy for consumers that compare direct and Code Mode calls. The root also exposes
[`ambient_sensitive_environment`](crate::ambient_sensitive_environment) for
deliberately restoring proxy-safe credential markers to tool subprocesses.

- [`contract`] contains complete model-visible inputs, outputs, errors, and
  retained wire forms.
- [`embedded`] contains the portable application-owned Code Mode boundary.
- [`runtime`] contains the stateful per-agent executor, built-in connection
  configuration, and dynamic-provider contract.
- [`code_mode`] contains cell results, notifications, and nested-tool updates.
- `mcp` contains transport configuration, authentication, discovery, login,
  and runtime control.
- `standard` contains reusable standard-tool identities and the host-owned
  plan implementation.
- [`workspace_runtime`] contains the retained canonical workspace-tool runtime
  used by process companions.
- [`image`] contains prompt-image preparation and tool-output normalization.
