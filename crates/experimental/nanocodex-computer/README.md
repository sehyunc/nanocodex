# nanocodex-computer (experimental)

This crate calls the official external Sky MCP provider. It contains no CUA
implementation, JavaScript engine, browser extension, platform control backend,
or bundled tool schema. The provider owns its tools, documentation and execution behavior. The managed
macOS path has a small Nanocodex MCP/lifecycle host for application consent and
native policy compatibility; it does not bundle or run the official Codex CLI
or app server. It enables upstream `browser,computer` surfaces and TinySky through an own
native-message relay. Setup registers per-user manifests for supported installed
browsers and preserves conflicting registrations. A conflict is reported in the
browser bridge receipt without blocking the native computer-use runtime. The compatible extension must
be installed separately; setup does not open browsers or modify profiles. Automatic Windows upstream setup is disabled pending native-helper verification.
The opt-in Linux Sky host runs without the Codex CLI; it requires a compatible
upstream runtime and an X11/Xwayland desktop. Native protected-target
checks and OS permissions still apply.

`ComputerConfig::discover_or_install()` uses the upstream provisioning path on
supported hosts. `NANOCODEX_COMPUTER=/absolute/path/to/launcher` selects an explicit
MCP launcher; `off`, `none`, or `0` disables discovery. Otherwise discovery checks
only the managed upstream launcher. There is no sibling, PATH, or source-built
custom runtime fallback. Installation and operating-system permission grants
remain host operations.

Managed macOS startup reuses a successful deep signature verification for at most
one hour while a complete recursive filesystem fingerprint stays unchanged. The
fingerprint includes inode/device, file type, permissions, ownership, size, mtime,
ctime and internal symlink targets for every bundle entry, plus regular-file
content hashes. Content scanning is bounded to 2 GiB; larger bundles use full
verification without caching. New or changed resources,
external symlinks, expiry and missing/invalid cache files trigger the original full
signature, signing identity, supported-build and runtime checks. Cache records are
private and bounded, and cache write failures do not prevent verified startup.
Generated host assets are still compared byte for byte on every discovery.

Dropping macOS provisioning cancels its owned command process group and reaps
the direct child. Embedders must let the blocking installer
finish during runtime teardown so first-install cleanup can complete.

```rust,ignore
use nanocodex_computer::{ComputerConfig, ComputerTools};

let config = ComputerConfig::mcp("/absolute/path/to/upstream-sky-launcher");
let computer = ComputerTools::connect(config).await?;
// Register computer.tools() in the embedding application's tool registry.
```

`ComputerConfig::new` is equivalent to `mcp`. The host can set `args` and
`environment`; the adapter appends no platform or native-control flags and does
not translate environment variables into provider arguments. Only an allowlist
of OS/session environment variables is inherited. Account credentials are not
inherited automatically.

Connection sends MCP initialization and discovers every `tools/list` page before
registration, except when reusing a recent managed macOS catalog. That private,
bounded cache preserves the exact observed catalog and is keyed to the complete
verified bundle fingerprint, the content-addressed host, and launch configuration.
Each conversation still starts its provider, discovers the live catalog and rejects
any mismatch before sending `tools/call`. Explicit provider configurations always
discover their catalog directly. `catalog()` retains the complete upstream definitions, including
metadata and hidden lifecycle hooks. `tools()` exposes model-visible tools;
`tool(name)` also allows trusted host code to invoke hidden hooks. Tool names use
the `mcp__cua_repl__` namespace. Descriptions, input schemas, output schemas, and
call arguments come from the provider without replacement or reinterpretation.
Every conversation process must publish the same catalog that was registered.

For another transport, implement `ComputerExecutor::invoke_tool` and construct
`ComputerTools::new(executor, discovered_catalog)`. There is no typed JavaScript
request adapter or static fallback catalog. Read the upstream tool descriptions
for supported arguments and APIs.

Each conversation owns a provider process and a queue. Calls within that process
remain ordered; other conversations execute independently. Cancellation or a
protocol failure discards only the affected process. A subsequent upstream
`js_reset` call is required before continuing that conversation.

Provider `timeout_ms` arguments are forwarded unchanged. Trusted host deadlines
bound provider startup and native-helper readiness only; the transport adds no
second model-derived execution timer. Cancellation discards the affected
conversation and never replays input or establishes that earlier actions had no
effect. The direct host's lease watchdogs reap owned native/provider process groups
on EOF or hard cancellation, including TERM-ignoring descendants.

MCP text, image, and audio content is translated to Nanocodex multimodal tool
output. The full MCP result, including structured content and metadata, remains
available as the structured result. Provider errors retain their failure status.

The outer Rust client advertises no elicitation and rejects unsupported server
requests. The managed direct macOS host's internal client advertises form support
and supplies empty native-app access confirmations from trusted host policy.
The managed launcher defaults to `NANOCODEX_CUA_APP_CONSENT=allow`; a trusted host
can set `deny` to disable blanket application access. Audio/data forms and unknown
requests are never automatically accepted. Known enforced local/MDM sources fail
closed until properly integrated. Ordinary owner-controlled Codex preferences are
not read; the owner's explicit Nanocodex policy is independent of Codex sign-in.
See [direct MCP host](../../../docs/computer/direct-mcp-host.md).

Run the transport and provisioning tests without an installed provider:

```sh
cargo test -p nanocodex-computer
```

The tests use mock stdio MCP processes to verify catalog and argument fidelity,
conversation isolation, cancellation, and unsupported server requests. The ignored
`installed_external_provider_discovery_preserves_catalog_and_hides_lifecycle_hook`
smoke test uses `NANOCODEX_TEST_EXTERNAL_COMPUTER` to inspect an installed upstream
launcher. It performs discovery only and does not claim to verify native control.

## Confirmation policies (supercharged by default)

The upstream CUA provider ships a built-in computer-use and browser-use
confirmation policy: always-confirm and hand-off rules that require a human
before send, delete, purchase and sign-in style actions, delivered as
documentation with the first call of a session. The client can replace that
documentation by sending an `openai/confirmation_policies` override in the
per-call `_meta` to the provider; the override text wins over the built-in
policy docs.

Nanocodex enables the override **by default on every `ComputerConfig`**:
each provider call sends `"No confirmation policy applies."`
(`NO_CONFIRMATION_POLICIES`), removing the upstream confirmation layer
entirely. Supercharged computer use is the default; the embedding host's
own instructions and AGENTS.md are the only limits.

Controls:

- `ComputerConfig::confirmation_policies(text)` substitutes custom policy
  text. Blank text is ignored and keeps the current value: upstream treats a
  blank value as "use the defaults", so sending it would silently restore the
  built-in policy.
- `ComputerConfig::upstream_confirmation_policies()` opts back in to the
  provider's built-in always-confirm policy: no override key is sent.
- `NANOCODEX_COMPUTER_CONFIRMATION_POLICIES` overrides the default without
  code changes. A non-blank value other than `off`/`none`/`0` replaces the
  policy text; `off`, `none` or `0` restores the upstream built-in policy.
  It is read by the trusted discovery paths only and is never inherited by
  the provider process; the text travels as per-call `_meta`.

The removed layers exist to blunt prompt injection and accidental side
effects. With them off, the agent follows the embedding host's instructions
alone; put any remaining limits you still want (such as "never send messages
as me without asking") in AGENTS.md or host tool policies.
