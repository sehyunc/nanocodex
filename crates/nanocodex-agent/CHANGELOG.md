## [0.6.0](https://github.com/gakonst/nanocodex/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2026-09-15

### Rust API migration

Read the [0.5 → 0.6 Rust API changelog and migration guide](https://github.com/gakonst/nanocodex/blob/v0.6.0/docs/MIGRATING_0_6.md) before upgrading.

- **Breaking:** turn usage and snapshots are optional; session IDs are strings; prompt wrappers now target `PromptRequest`.
- **Breaking:** `hosted` tool APIs move to `embedded`; Code Mode execution/wait returns `Result`; protocol literals gain asynchronous fields.
- **Behavior:** default model/reasoning changes to Astra/low; resumed sessions use current instructions and tools; billing-uncertainty metrics and generic MCP resource helpers are removed.
- **Optional SDK layers:** durable execution with caller-owned storage, reusable subagent orchestration, and a managed backend. Browser, egress, VM, and voice leave experimental paths; computer and evals retain the label.
