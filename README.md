Nanocodex is a headless, library-first SDK for building products around one
deliberately supported OpenAI coding-agent stack. It is not a provider
abstraction and it is not an app server. The public product is an embeddable
agent with an owned lifecycle; the native CLI/TUI, browser apps, Python and
JavaScript packages, durable actors, sandboxes, voice client, and evaluation
harness are consumers that prove the same contract.

The important difference from assembling a model client and a loop is what the
caller does **not** have to rebuild:

- no passing previous messages, response IDs, or tool results back on every
  turn;
- no separate state machine for prompt ordering, steering, compaction,
  reconnect replay, or partially completed responses;
- no coupling between receiving a typed result and consuming an event stream;
- no orphaned shell sessions or subprocess trees when a turn is cancelled; and
- no second orchestration runtime when an agent forks or delegates work.

The interface is deliberately not part of that list. Consume ordered typed
events in a native TUI, wterm, xterm.js, React, logs, or something that only
your product could have. The included renderers are complete consumers, not a
UI protocol every embedding must adopt.

## Desktop app

The [native SwiftUI/AppKit macOS app](macos/README.md) is Nanocodex's only desktop
app. It owns the tiled workspace, persistent sidebar or top tabs, streamed
conversations, agent activity menu bar, and automatic background Mac Hand.
Choosing a folder and sending automatically connects compute for that thread.
Its managed-agent transport and local, VM, and cloud Hand lifecycle live in
[`@nanocodex/desktop-runtime`](js/desktop-runtime/README.md).
The separate [mobile Inbox](apple/README.md) targets iPhone and iPad only.

Build the desktop app with `pnpm build:macos` after preparing the documented
bundled Node runtime. The [macOS README](macos/README.md) describes account setup,
native controls, and real-service verification.

## Install

Choose the host language; each path runs the Rust-owned agent lifecycle. The
Rust crates and core JavaScript `nanocodex` binding are registry releases. The
Python binding and JavaScript companion packages under `js/` are currently
built from the repository checkout.

```sh
# Rust
cargo add nanocodex

# Node.js 22.13+
npm install nanocodex

# Python 3.11+ (from a checkout)
uv venv --python 3.11 py/bindings/.venv
uv pip install --python py/bindings/.venv/bin/python 'maturin>=1.9,<2'
VIRTUAL_ENV="$PWD/py/bindings/.venv" \
  py/bindings/.venv/bin/maturin develop --manifest-path py/bindings/Cargo.toml
```

The Node.js 22.13+ line is the published package's consumer floor. Developing
from this repository uses Rust 1.97, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target,
`wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.126, Node.js 24 from `.node-version`, and pnpm 11.25.0
from the root `packageManager` field:

```sh
rustup toolchain install 1.97
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.97
cargo +1.97 install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.126
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the complete Turbo stack through Portless. Local HTTPS needs
one-time certificate trust, and binding port 443 may also need administrator
approval on macOS. `PORTLESS_PORT=1355 pnpm dev` avoids the privileged bind and
serves the same names with `:1355` appended. Portless's proxy is user-global,
while app routes, processes, and Wrangler state remain isolated per checkout
and worktree.

Before pushing Rust changes, `pnpm check:fast` runs `cargo fmt` and the CI
Clippy command on the crates changed since `origin/master` and their workspace
dependents.

Or install the native CLI/TUI on Apple Silicon macOS or x86-64 glibc Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nanocodex.paradigm.xyz | bash
nanocodex
```

Nix users can run or install the package directly on x86-64 Linux and Apple
Silicon macOS:

```sh
nix run github:gakonst/nanocodex
nix profile install github:gakonst/nanocodex
```

The flake also provides optional NixOS and nix-darwin modules. Add the input and
the module matching your system:

```nix
{
  inputs.nanocodex.url = "github:gakonst/nanocodex";

  imports = [
    inputs.nanocodex.nixosModules.default
    # For nix-darwin, use inputs.nanocodex.darwinModules.default instead.
  ];

  programs.nanocodex.enable = true;
}
```

The NixOS module also enables the dynamic loader required by verified Linux
runtime components that Nanocodex downloads itself. Intel macOS is not included
because the upstream release does not currently publish an x86-64 macOS binary.

On x86-64 Windows 10 or 11, the equivalent checksum-verified bootstrap is:

```powershell
irm https://nanocodex.paradigm.xyz/install.ps1 | iex
nanocodex
```

On macOS and Linux, the installer prepares the persistent Hand before sign-in,
even without an interactive terminal. Sign in once with `nanocodex account login`
or `nanocodex2 login`; the Hand connects automatically using that saved login.
There is no separate Hand setup command. An existing service keeps its account
configuration. Desktop components prepare in the background while you use
Nanocodex. Linux preparation requires sudo and runs component installation in a
root-owned systemd oneshot; the Hand itself runs as a non-root user.
`--no-setup` explicitly opts out of automatic preparation.

`nanocodex2`, `run`, and `attach` use this persistent computer Hand. Opening a
terminal or changing projects does not publish another Hand or reconnect its
tools. Closing a terminal releases only that client's local lease; the service
and its processes remain available. The current directory travels as descriptive
request context, independently of the Hand's identity and connection. If the
service is unavailable, the client does not substitute a workspace publisher.

On Windows, the installer runs guided setup when a terminal or saved
account login is available; unattended installs print the command to resume.
Setup remains idempotent and resumable.

The POSIX or PowerShell script only selects and checksum-verifies one platform
bootstrap.
Native Rust then installs the matching CLI, Hand, and voice bundle, updates the
shell PATH, configures an hourly per-user updater through launchd, systemd, or
Task Scheduler, and owns every setup step. Background activation is
transactional with the macOS and Windows Hand; a running Hand is never silently
restarted.

Release bundles include the native voice helper, libraries, and plugins.
Installation and updates verify and install them with the matching CLI version;
voice users do not need to run a source build. The updater checks cached runtime
files and repairs missing or corrupt resources before activating that release.
For upgrades performed by an older updater, the CLI repairs its matching runtime
automatically on first voice use.

On macOS, current native CLIs prepare OpenAI's signed CUA runtime in the
background. The downloader fetches only the required archive ranges. Every
macOS, Linux, or Windows Hand also publishes its native controllable screen,
subject to the operating system's permissions. The native screen is available
while optional upstream components prepare. A newly prepared upstream provider
is selected on the next attachment; running tool catalogs remain pinned.
Windows upstream provisioning is currently unavailable; its Hand uses native
screen controls. Use `nanocodex computer setup` to wait for preparation or
`nanocodex computer setup --refresh` to repair/update it. Background setup writes
progress and errors to `~/.nanocodex/runtimes/openai-cua/setup.log` (under
`NANOCODEX_DIR` when set). `NANOCODEX_COMPUTER=off` disables upstream provisioning.
See [runtime installation and platform limits](docs/computer/upstream-provider.md).

The CLI is a production consumer and a useful way to try the agent, not a
process protocol that applications must adopt. See
[`bin/nanocodex`](bin/nanocodex), the [examples index](examples/README.md), and
the [release switcher documentation](bin/nanocodex/src/update.rs).

To install a branch or an open pull request from source, run
`nanocodex update --branch master` or `nanocodex update --pr 123`. Both commands fetch the selected
revision and compile the CLI and Hand locally with Cargo. PR selection also
requires `gh`. The updater reuses its checkout and Cargo cache under
`~/.nanocodex/source-build`, builds both binaries together, and uses the optimized
`nightly` profile without release LTO. Cargo timing reports are saved under
`~/.nanocodex/source-build/target/cargo-timings` (or your `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`).
These source builds do not package the native voice runtime.

For managed agents, `nanocodex2 login` signs in with an SMS code and saves an
account key; `nanocodex2 status` verifies it, and `nanocodex2 logout` removes the
local login. `nanocodex account login/status/logout` manages the same saved account. Account
keys are separate from `nanocodex auth` (ChatGPT provider credentials) and
`nanocodex login/connect/status/logout` (Connect installation grants). See the
[CLI account sign-in guide](bin/nanocodex/nanocodex2/README.md#account-sign-in)
for environment overrides, storage, and key revocation.

To use Nanocodex capabilities from Codex, Claude, or another MCP client,
connect to the [remote MCP server](docs/connect-mcp.md) and approve access through
Nanocodex Connect.

To connect multiple ChatGPT subscriptions, open **Connect → ChatGPT → Add account**
on the web. Sign in to the additional ChatGPT account, enter the displayed code,
then return to Nanocodex. The card lists every account ID, the default account,
and any quota reset time. Adding an account preserves existing connections;
**Disconnect all ChatGPT accounts** removes the entire pool.

On iPhone and iPad, open **Connectors → ChatGPT accounts**. On Mac, open
**Settings → Account → Manage ChatGPT accounts** (or **Connections** in the app
menu). These open the same web page; sign in there with the same Nanocodex account
used in the native app.

From the CLI, import one Codex login at a time and approve each connection:

```sh
nanocodex connect chatgpt --auth-file /path/to/account-one/auth.json
nanocodex connect chatgpt --auth-file /path/to/account-two/auth.json
```

Without `--auth-file`, the command uses the current Codex login. Each distinct
ChatGPT account is retained (up to 20); reconnecting the same account does not
create a duplicate. The most recently connected account is preferred. Hosted
model requests automatically switch to another connected account when ChatGPT
reports subscription exhaustion. Exhausted accounts become eligible again at
the provider's reset time, or after one minute if no reset time is supplied.
Ordinary request-rate limits do not switch accounts. Existing Nanocodex sessions
reconnect with their full conversation history when switching before output
begins; a failure after output begins is surfaced to avoid replaying partial
work. Disconnecting ChatGPT removes all connected ChatGPT accounts.

To test a specific connected account, pin a new session using its `account_id`
from the connector status (`chatgpt.accounts`):

```sh
nanocodex2 new --chatgpt-account <account-id>
nanocodex2 run --chatgpt-account <account-id> "Reply with hello"
```

The pin stays with the session across reconnects and resumes. Pinned sessions
surface that account's subscription limit instead of switching accounts, and do
not change the preferred account for other sessions. Unknown or disconnected
account IDs fail without falling back to another account or provider. New
sessions without a pin keep automatic failover.

Managed API callers can set `configuration.chatgpt_account_id` when creating an
agent (including `Agent.create` / `Agent.createAndPrompt` in JavaScript). Rust
callers can use `ManagedClient::create_with_chatgpt_account(settings, account_id)`.


### Managed Claude subscription

Connect **Claude** in the account Connections screen to use the native Claude
Messages runtime. OAuth input stays in the private connection form, and model
availability comes from the account-scoped provider catalog. OpenAI credentials
are not required for a Claude-only account. See the
[managed Claude guide](docs/CLAUDE_MANAGED.md) for native clients, API routes,
refresh/recovery, supported tools, current limits and deployment acceptance.

### Native Linux Hands

Install or repair the Hand on the current Linux machine after account login:

```sh
nanocodex hand install
```

Or enroll a remote Linux machine from an already authenticated host. The remote
machine does not perform account login:

```sh
nanocodex hand install --target ubuntu@your-server
nanocodex hand install --target ubuntu@your-server --port 2222
```

Both commands install the same native Hand and private controllable desktop.
Setup supports x86-64 Debian/Ubuntu and Arch/Omarchy with systemd and sudo. On-device
setup can prompt for your administrator password; SSH enrollment uses your
existing SSH keys/configuration and requires passwordless sudo.

The client verifies the release checksum, uploads only the native Rust
`nanocodex2` binary, and passes the account credential privately over stdin.
The binary installs itself and waits for both Hand registration and its screen
catalog; no Python, Bash installer, or remote interactive login is involved.
`nanocodex-hand.service` starts at boot and reconnects independently of SSH.
Re-running setup reuses the identity and private workspace under
`/srv/nanocodex`; an installation enrolled to another account or origin is
rejected. A fresh sudo installation runs the service as the invoking non-root
user; existing installations retain their service owner. Only that owner can
observe the daemon through private IPC, including from terminals with different
`HOME` values. Account credentials stay in the root-owned mode-0600
`/opt/nanocodex/account.env`.

`nanocodex hand install --prepare` prepares the local service before login.
It starts `nanocodex-hand-components.service` asynchronously and leaves the Hand
unpublished until sign-in supplies the saved account login.

The same lifecycle commands work for the local LaunchAgent, systemd service, or
Windows scheduled task:
`nanocodex hand status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart`.

### Windows Hand

Run the PowerShell bootstrap above, or download
`nanocodex-hand-setup-x86_64.exe` from the latest release and double-click it on
an x86-64 Windows 10 or 11 computer. Keep **Sign in and connect this computer
now** selected, then enter the account phone number and six-digit SMS code.
The current per-user installer and subsequent updates do not require
administrator access.

The installer ships the same `nanocodex` and `nanocodex2` Rust binaries as the
other platforms. The shared guided setup provisions OpenAI’s official
computer-use runtime, uses the shared per-user account login, and has Rust
register a hidden interactive startup task with failure recovery. Running in
the signed-in session is deliberate: capture, UI Automation, and input cannot
control that desktop from a Session 0 service. The same `nanocodex hand
install/status/start/stop/restart` commands work from a new terminal.
See [`windows/hand`](windows/hand) for behavior, security boundaries, build
instructions, and the real Notepad control smoke test.

## Native CLI harnesses

`nanocodex --claude` starts the native Claude Messages agent with OMP-style
subscription authentication. Sign in once, then select a model within that family:

```sh
nanocodex --claude auth login
nanocodex --claude --model sonnet
nanocodex run "inspect the repository" --harness claude --model opus
nanocodex run "inspect the repository" --harness codex --model sol
```

In the interactive local CLI, `/model` lists both Codex and Claude models before
the first prompt. Select one from the picker, or enter `/model sonnet`, `/model opus`,
`/model fable`, or `/model haiku` directly. Selecting another family creates its
native harness with that family's credentials and default reasoning settings.
The model is fixed once the thread starts; start a new thread to use another model.

Use `nanocodex --claude auth status` or `nanocodex --claude auth logout` to manage
that subscription.
Claude roots and Claude children share its token-refresh manager, including when
the root uses Codex. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `--claude-api-key` explicitly selects
Console API-key authentication instead. Claude credentials are encrypted outside
agent sessions; `--claude-auth-file` overrides their private store. See
[Claude authentication](docs/claude-authentication.md) for setup and recovery.

`spawn_agent` accepts `harness: "codex" | "claude"` and a model within that
family. Null values inherit the parent family and its current settings; switching
families uses the selected family's defaults. Mixed children share the same task
tree, result contracts and lifecycle tools. Each family uses its own credentials,
native tools and transcript format. A model from the wrong family fails before
provider dispatch. Claude aliases are `opus`, `sonnet`, `fable` and `haiku`.

Libraries compose the same routing through [`Harness`](crates/nanocodex/README.md)
with concrete provider builders and host-owned construction recipes.

## Rust: start here

Build one agent, submit ordered prompts through its cheap handle, and await a
typed result:

```rust,no_run
use nanocodex::{Nanocodex, OpenAi};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let openai = OpenAi::new(std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?)?;
    let (agent, _events) = Nanocodex::builder(openai)
        .instructions(
            "You are a Rust coding agent. Preserve unrelated work and run relevant tests.",
        )
        .workspace(std::env::current_dir()?)
        .build()?;

    let turn = agent.prompt("Find and fix the failing parser test.").await?;
    let result = turn.await?;
    println!("{}", result.final_message());

    agent.shutdown().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The first `await` accepts and orders the prompt. The returned `Turn` is both an
independently awaitable future for `TurnResult` and an optional per-turn event
stream. The separate `AgentEvents` value is the session-wide stream; neither
stream has to be drained for the result to complete.

Follow-on prompts reuse the same retained typed history, persistent Responses
WebSocket, response chain, cache identity, tools, Code Mode worker, and shell
sessions. `agent.clone()` is a constant-time command capability to that same
session. `shutdown()` cancels unfinished work and joins model, tool, transport,
and process cleanup.

The runnable source is [`examples/minimal.rs`](examples/minimal.rs). For event
streaming, steering, cancellation, clean spawning, historical forks, and
snapshots, see [`examples/lifecycle.rs`](examples/lifecycle.rs),
[`examples/follow_on.rs`](examples/follow_on.rs), and
[`examples/resume.rs`](examples/resume.rs).

Nanocodex supports OpenAI `gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`, and
`gpt-6-astra`. New native CLI and managed `nanocodex2` conversations default to Sol with
xhigh reasoning and fast mode enabled. SDK and account-app conversations default to Astra. Sponsored homepage sessions use Luna. Astra
requires at least low reasoning. Nanocodex owns the typed Responses WebSocket behavior for this closed
model family. An API-key gateway may prefix the on-wire model identifier with
`NANOCODEX_MODEL_ID_PREFIX`, but that does not create an alternate-provider or
arbitrary-model API. See [GPT-6 model contracts and upstream sources](docs/GPT_6_MODELS.md).

## One agent, owned end to end

```text
your application
  ├─ cheap Nanocodex command handle ── prompt / steer / cancel / fork
  ├─ optional typed events ─────────── UI / persistence / telemetry
  ├─ caller-defined tools ──────────── your data and capabilities
  ├─ optional durability layer ─────── total state / recovery / stores
  └─ private driver
       ├─ ordered turns and typed committed history
       ├─ persistent OpenAI Responses WebSocket + typed retries
       ├─ Code Mode, MCP, shell sessions, and process cleanup
       └─ snapshots, compaction, branches, and task-tree children
```

### Sessions and history are authoritative

The private spawned driver is the sole mutable owner. A healthy follow-on sends
only the new delta with its private continuation checkpoint. If the socket is
replaced or a stored checkpoint is unavailable, Nanocodex drops the checkpoint
and safely replays complete client-owned typed history. Only completed
responses enter history: a failed partial response cannot execute a tool or
become the base of a later turn.

That gives an embedding a simple contract:

- `prompt()` is bounded admission, not a hidden full-turn wait;
- accepted prompts retain FIFO ordering even when their `Turn` handles are
  awaited elsewhere;
- steering joins at the next safe model boundary;
- cancellation targets one active or queued turn and terminates managed
  subprocess groups;
- snapshots contain the complete committed conversation and can resume in a
  fresh process; and
- token usage, cache behavior, and estimated USD cost arrive on the same typed
  terminal result.

The implementation boundaries are documented in
[`nanocodex-agent`](crates/nanocodex-agent/README.md) and
[`nanocodex-oai-api`](crates/nanocodex-oai-api/README.md). Applications that
only need a managed OpenAI conversation can use the lower-level
`OpenAi -> Session -> ResponseTurn -> Response` API without adopting agent
policy. The Responses client remains generic over the caller's concrete Tower
service, so deadlines, concurrency limits, tracing, load shedding, and circuit
breaking stay composable without introducing a second retry owner.

### Durable execution is optional and Rust-owned

`nanocodex-durability` adds a replace-in-place total execution state and
recovery policy, operation deduplication, committed-output replay, and session
checkpoints. It includes memory, SQLite, and Postgres stores, plus a
host-provided store contract whose only requirement is atomic load and
fenced compare-and-replace. Rust owns the state format and every recovery decision.
Model calls, warmup, compaction, and tools share one effect admission result:
execute when no output is committed, or replay the exact committed output.
Unfinished effects are deliberately at-least-once and may be billed or applied
again after recovery. Live attempts are fenced in-memory capabilities, not a
second durable state machine.

The layer implements the agent's neutral execution-policy seam; the core agent
does not depend on it. Lower-level consumers can use `DurableSession` directly
with caller-owned operation, step, checkpoint, and output types. It currently
ships from repository source; read the
[durability guide](crates/nanocodex-durability/README.md) and pin a Git revision
when adopting it outside this workspace.


Enable the `claude` feature on `nanocodex-durability` to use the same stores,
admission rules, and receipts with the Claude builder. Claude checkpoints keep
native Messages content, including signed thinking and tool results. The
application supplies its authenticated client again when reopening a session;
credentials are never part of a checkpoint. The `nanocodex` facade's `claude`
feature also enables the adapter when its durability feature is enabled.
[Subscription login](docs/claude-authentication.md) uses a Rust-owned OAuth manager
with separate private credential storage and the same agent builder.

```rust,ignore
use nanocodex_agent::{Nanocodex, PromptRequest};
use nanocodex_claude::{Claude, ClaudeClient};
use nanocodex_durability::{DurableAgentExt, DurableSession, MemoryStore};

let client = ClaudeClient::official(
    reqwest::Client::new(),
    std::env::var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")?,
);
let state = DurableSession::open(MemoryStore::new()?, "claude-session").await?;
let (agent, events) = Nanocodex::builder(Claude::latest(client))
    .durability(state).await?
    .build()?;
let result = agent.prompt(
    PromptRequest::new("hello").request_id("request-7"),
).await?.result().await?;
```

Choose `SqliteStore`, `PostgresStore`, or a persistent host store to retain work
across process restarts. Reopen the same state ID and replay the same request ID
and input to recover pending work or return its committed receipt. Unfinished
Claude effects follow the same at-least-once execution rule described above.
Claude snapshots use the store's chunked immutable payloads; they do not yet
use the OpenAI adapter's per-message context pages. Snapshot serialization and
restoration therefore process the full retained Claude context.

### Tools, Code Mode, and MCP

Tools are caller-owned capabilities, not callbacks hidden behind a global
runtime. Register the standard workspace set, implement the typed `Tool`
contract, or write a Rust function with `#[tool]`:

```rust,no_run
use nanocodex::{Nanocodex, OpenAi, Tools, tool};

#[tool(description = "Multiplies two signed integers.")]
async fn multiply(left: i64, right: i64) -> Result<i64, &'static str> {
    left.checked_mul(right).ok_or("integer overflow")
}

# fn build(openai: OpenAi) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let tools = Tools::builder().without_defaults().tool(multiply).build()?;
let (_agent, _events) = Nanocodex::builder(openai).tools(tools).build()?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The default native workspace runtime supplies bounded `exec_command`, retained
`write_stdin` sessions, Rust-verified `apply_patch`, `view_image`, planning,
web search, and image generation. Code Mode presents one compositional
JavaScript execution tool to the model; inside a cell, ordinary code can loop,
branch, fan out with `Promise.all`, and call typed tools through
`await tools.<name>(...)`. The runtime bounds code, tool output, process output,
and cancellation while keeping the model-facing schema compact.

MCP is part of the native tools crate rather than a separate agent runtime.
The `nanocodex` CLI and Cloudflare managed agents (including `nanocodex2`
conversations) include [Mercator](https://mercator.sh/setup.md) discovery at
`https://mercator.sh/mcp` in their default MCP catalog. Discover its tools with
`tool_search`; free discovery alone does not authorize a paid job. Native
`--mcp-defaults=false` disables the CLI defaults, and a named MCP entry can
override Mercator. In Nanocodex web, Mercator's default MCP server can use the
account's funded Tempo wallet for an in-band `create_job` payment challenge, without an extra
payment tool or connection. The broker keeps the signing key private, checks
the payment challenge against a fresh quote of the unchanged plan and
retains idempotency across retries. Nanocodex adds no separate spending limit;
Mercator's quoted total and MCP payment challenge govern the job charge. No
wallet or insufficient funds leaves free discovery available but cannot
execute a paid job. Connect grants do not inherit this owner-wallet payment
path. Native `--provider.tempo` instead
uses a separately configured local Tempo Accounts wallet for MPP challenges.

Stdio and Streamable HTTP servers are discovered in the background; deferred
tools remain out of the initial model prefix, are found with BM25
`tool_search`, and become callable by their canonical
`mcp__<server>__<tool>` names from Code Mode. OAuth persistence, allow/deny
lists, bounded concurrent startup, hot reload, and caller-owned clients live at
that boundary.

Read [`crates/nanocodex-oai-tools`](crates/nanocodex-oai-tools/README.md), run
[`examples/custom_tool.rs`](examples/custom_tool.rs), or start the complete MCP
example in [`examples/mcp.rs`](examples/mcp.rs):

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=... cargo run -p nanocodex-examples --bin custom-tool
OPENAI_API_KEY=... cargo run -p nanocodex-examples --bin mcp
```

### Branches, snapshots, and subagents

Branching is a lifecycle primitive, not cloned mutable state:

- `spawn()` creates a clean agent with the same private builder configuration
  and no conversation history;
- `fork()` creates an independent session from the latest safe committed
  boundary;
- `fork_from(&completed_turn)` pins an exact historical checkpoint; and
- `SessionSnapshot` serializes authoritative committed history for later
  process or actor resumption without exposing provider response IDs.

Forked drivers get their own socket, prompt queue, tools, and cancellation
domain. Shared immutable history makes local fork-and-append constant-time, and
the retained provider checkpoint keeps healthy branch requests delta-sized.
See the runnable [`fork-conversations`](examples/fork_conversations.rs) example.

[`nanocodex-subagents`](crates/nanocodex-subagents/README.md) is an optional
extension above the core. It installs a shared task-tree registry and seven
agent-relative tools—spawn, structured result submission, directed messaging,
listing, waiting, interrupting, and closing—fresh for every root, child, and
fork. The root owns recursive cleanup. Native and WASM applications use the
same Rust implementation; the core agent crate does not depend on it and does
not become a general scheduler.

This lets the model synthesize a temporary orchestration program in Code Mode
without requiring the host to declare a DAG. The executable examples are
[`examples/subagents.rs`](examples/subagents.rs) and
[`examples/node/subagents.mjs`](examples/node/subagents.mjs).

## JavaScript: Node, browser, and WASM

The repository's `nanocodex` package exposes viem-style `Agent`, `Actions`, and
`Transport` namespaces for Node and browser hosts. The current registry release
contains the core root, Node, browser, and WASM entrypoints; newer browser-tool
and subagent exports shown below currently require a pinned checkout. The
Rust/WASM engine still
owns prompt ordering, history, tool calls, branching, snapshots, and cleanup;
JavaScript owns WebSocket creation, credentials, UI, persistence, and ordinary
application tools.

### Node.js

```js
import { Agent, Transport } from "nanocodex/node";

const agent = await Agent.create({
  transport: Transport.openAi({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
  instructions: "You are a coding agent. Make focused changes and verify them.",
  workspace: process.cwd(),
  tools: [{
    name: "lookup_issue",
    description: "Return one issue by number.",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { number: { type: "integer" } },
      required: ["number"],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    handler: ({ number }) => issueTracker.get(number),
  }],
});

try {
  const turn = agent.turn.prompt({ input: "Fix issue 42." });
  try {
    const result = await turn.result();
    try {
      console.log(result.finalMessage, await result.usage());
    } finally {
      result.dispose();
    }
  } finally {
    turn.dispose();
  }
} finally {
  await agent.session.shutdown();
}
```

Use `Transport.chatGpt({ subscription })` for a caller-owned ChatGPT
subscription or `Transport.mpp({ session })` for a caller-owned MPP session.
Transport constructors are explicit immutable configurations; Nanocodex does
not infer provider portability from them. See the complete
[JavaScript guide](js/nanocodex/README.md) and runnable
[Node session](examples/node/session.mjs).

### A complete coding workspace in a browser

The browser entrypoint runs the same Rust agent in a Worker. It can open a
persistent origin-private filesystem (OPFS) workspace and compose a lazy
WASM-backed shell with Python through Pyodide, C/C++ through wasm-clang,
browser Git, bounded file commands, web and image tools, artifacts, and the
optional Rust subagent tree:

```js
import { Agent, Subagents, Transport } from "nanocodex/browser";
import { browser } from "nanocodex/tools/browser";

const runtime = await browser({
  threadId: "project-42",
  recentImages,
  rememberImage,
});

const agent = await Agent.create({
  transport: Transport.hostManaged({
    websocketUrl: "/api/responses",
    createWebSocket: (url) => new WebSocket(url),
  }),
  filesystem: runtime.filesystem,
  instructions: runtime.instructions,
  executionEnvironment: {
    currentDate: "2026-08-19",
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",
    projectInstructions: runtime.projectInstructions,
  },
  tools: [...runtime.tools, ...Subagents.create({ maxConcurrency: 8 })],
});
```

This is a browser-native workspace: files persist across page, Worker, and
agent restarts, and coding can happen without provisioning a server-side
sandbox. It is **not** a claim that OPFS or in-browser execution is an
untrusted-code security sandbox. Products that need stronger isolation should
provide remote caller-defined tools or use one of the VM/container consumers
below.

Browser WebSockets cannot attach OpenAI's authorization header, so
`Transport.hostManaged` expects an application-authorized same-origin relay;
the API key stays out of the page and WASM artifact. The one-file
[`browser-cdn`](examples/browser-cdn/README.md) consumer needs no bundler or
framework. The [`React + Vite`](examples/react-vite/README.md) example keeps
one persistent agent in a module Worker and forwards ordered events into React.

The package also exposes composable browser-safe web search, image generation,
public Parquet/JSONL/Hugging Face dataset queries, and live React artifact
tools. Read their exact contracts and bounds in
[`js/nanocodex/README.md`](js/nanocodex/README.md#standard-web-and-browser-tools).

### Bring any terminal or product interface

To attach to a running `nanocodex` or `nanocodex2` TUI, use
`tui list --json` and `tui connect INSTANCE_UUID --stdio`. The
[rich terminal protocol](docs/RICH_TERMINAL_INTEGRATION.md) provides authenticated
local/SSH control, replayable events, draft-preserving commands, and UI state.

`agent.events.watch()` and the intentionally narrow `nanocodex-react` Context
and hooks expose ordered typed data independently from `Turn.result()`. The SDK
does not make a DOM transcript or terminal emulator authoritative. UI
frameworks and terminal renderers consume Agent events directly and remain
application code. Those events can feed wterm, xterm.js, Ink, a design-system
transcript, persistence, or telemetry without adding a UI protocol to the SDK.

The application owns event reduction, ANSI presentation, line editing, prompt
history, steering, cancellation, and terminal subscriptions alongside the
agent, tools, transport, persistence, authorization, and shutdown. The
[Vercel Workflow example](examples/vercel-workflows/README.md) demonstrates
that application-owned seam with a durable replay journal and `@wterm/react`;
its separate Sandbox PTY remains a distinct shell-byte lifecycle.

## Python

The Python wheel embeds the native Rust runtime through PyO3. Blocking result
waits release the GIL; all agents in a process share one async runtime, while
each agent retains its own driver, WebSocket, history, Code Mode worker, and
cleanup boundary.

```python
import os
from nanocodex import Nanocodex

agent, events = Nanocodex(
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    instructions="You are a coding agent. Preserve unrelated work.",
)

first = agent.prompt("Remember the identifier PYO3_17.").result()
second = agent.prompt("Return the identifier I asked you to remember.").result()
print(second.final_message)

branch, branch_events = agent.fork_from(first)
print(branch.prompt("What was the identifier?").result().final_message)

branch.shutdown()
agent.shutdown()
```

Python exposes typed event envelopes, steering, per-turn cancellation,
compaction, thinking and fast-mode policy, `spawn`, `fork`, `fork_from`,
snapshots, and resume. Start with the [Python guide](py/bindings/README.md) and
the runnable [`examples/python`](examples/python) consumers.

## Web search and a real browser agent

Web search and browser automation are different capabilities. The stable tool
runtime includes the bounded OpenAI/Codex-compatible web-search boundary, and
JavaScript hosts can use the matching `web()` factory. Applications decide
which network tool to install and where credentials live.

Nanocodex agents use a Hand's `cua_repl` MCP provider for browser interaction.
Route each CUA call with `workdir`, just like a shell call. First call
`tools.mcp__cua_repl__js({workdir: "/desktop"})` to read the provider contract;
then pass its arguments alongside `workdir`. The host consumes `workdir` and
forwards every other argument unchanged. There is no `select_computer` tool or
global target. Different Hands can run concurrently in one Code Mode cell:

```js
await Promise.all([
  tools.mcp__cua_repl__js({ workdir: "/desktop", code: desktopCode }),
  tools.mcp__cua_repl__js({ workdir: "/vm", code: vmCode }),
]);
```

Read each provider's contract first; `code` above assumes that provider's schema.
JS and reset calls to the same Hand are ordered. Each cell pins its captured Hand
connections, as shell routing does. A published screen alone does not provide
CUA; attach a supported computer or report the missing capability.

The managed cloud runtime and native/VM Hands do not expose `browser_execute`
or the managed `browser_vault_*` tools. Secure Vault intake remains available,
but automated Vault browser login needs a supported private CUA integration.
Do not pass Vault secrets into CUA code or ordinary tool arguments.

The source-distributed [`nanocodex-browser`](crates/nanocodex-browser/README.md)
library remains in the workspace for explicit library consumers and legacy
utilities; it is disabled as an agent browser backend.

## VMs, sandboxes, and voice

These are application-owned adapters over the same agent session, not alternate
agent runtimes.

### Retained VM workspaces

The supported source-distributed
[`nanocodex-vm`](crates/nanocodex-vm/README.md) crate owns the
libkrun boundary. An application launches one private workspace, retains it
across sequential turns, and swaps only `exec_command`, `write_stdin`,
`apply_patch`, and `view_image` for guest-backed implementations with the same
model-visible names and schemas. Web search, image generation, and planning can
remain on the host.

Immutable OCI/Dockerfile roots are content-addressed; each retained session
gets a writable private ext4 copy, while high-fanout attempts can use a fresh
sparse OverlayFS upper. The non-cloneable workspace is the shutdown capability,
and clone-cheap tool handles share its filesystem and interactive shells.
Cancellation, output limits, process groups, egress leases, VMM process, guest
runtime, and disk cleanup all have explicit owners.

The CLI can exercise the same boundary:

```sh
just build-vm-guest
nanocodex run "inspect the repository" \
  --vm .nanocodex/vm/session-rootfs.ext4 \
  --vm-guest-runtime target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/debug/nanocodex-vm-guest \
  --vm-workspace /app
```

See the [VM operations guide](docs/VM.md) for image preparation, libkrun,
Linux KVM, macOS signing, networking, and egress.

### Voice is another input to the retained agent

The supported
[`nanocodex-voice`](crates/nanocodex-voice/README.md) crate connects
GPT Realtime to an existing `Nanocodex` session. Speech while idle starts an
independently awaitable coding turn; speech while work is active atomically
steers it at the next safe model boundary. Typed work is mirrored back to the
voice session, while stopping audio does not silently cancel coding work.

The default-device adapter supports macOS and Windows. The lower device-neutral
Realtime boundary reads and writes raw 24 kHz mono PCM16, so other applications
can own capture, codecs, sockets, or playback:

```sh
nanocodex auth login
cargo run -p nanocodex-examples --bin voice
cargo run -p nanocodex-examples --bin realtime-pipe \
  < microphone.pcm > speaker.pcm
```

Runnable sources: [`examples/voice.rs`](examples/voice.rs) and
[`examples/realtime_pipe.rs`](examples/realtime_pipe.rs).

The managed terminal UI also supports [ChatGPT and ElevenLabs voice switching
and instant cloning](docs/voice/terminal.md) through `/voice` commands.

## Evaluation is a product boundary

Evals are not a score pasted onto the end of development. They are how the
session, tool, VM, event, and cleanup contracts are exercised together.

The experimental, unpublished
[`nanocodex-eval`](crates/experimental/nanocodex-eval/README.md) layer runs every
attempt and its canonical verifier in a microVM. `eval add` fingerprints tasks
and pre-materializes one immutable SQLite row for every
task/treatment/repetition. Workers atomically claim exactly one row; verifier
pass/fail is terminal, while infrastructure failure is retained in attempt
history and safely returns work for another claim. A claim ID fences late
writes.

The durable ledger—not a TOML recipe, controller memory, or inferred queue—is
the authority. Each arm receives a fresh writable overlay. The retained output
contains raw JSONL, typed trajectories, model API exchanges and summaries,
usage, verifier reward/stdout/stderr, and exact treatment coordinates. External
harnesses such as stock Codex are independent coordinates using the same task,
isolation, capture proxy, verifier, and evidence format; differential reports
are offline joins rather than special comparison behavior in the agent.

```sh
# Materialize an immutable generation from the repository recipe.
nanocodex eval add local-smoke --recipe local-smoke

# Inspect state without deriving or adding work.
nanocodex eval status local-smoke --json

# Atomically claim and run one row, or let the benchmark consumer size workers.
nanocodex eval run local-smoke
nanocodex eval benchmark local-smoke
```

Task packages are ordinary inputs with agent instructions, a starting
environment, hidden deterministic tests, and an oracle used to validate the
task itself. Explore [`tasks/`](tasks), the
[history-derived suite](evals/history-derived/README.md), and the
[comparison-plan contract](evals/harbor-comparisons/README.md). Benchmark tasks
and verifiers are never modified to make Nanocodex pass.

## Deployment proofs

Nanocodex does not impose a generic app-server protocol. These applications
show how different products can own authentication, idempotency, durable state,
client projection, and sandbox policy while reusing one agent lifecycle:

| Consumer | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| [Native CLI and Ratatui TUI](bin/nanocodex) | Interactive sessions, JSONL one-shot adapter, branching UI, MCP, browser, VM, voice, and full lifecycle cleanup. |
| [Static browser CDN page](examples/browser-cdn/README.md) | One HTML file runs the Rust/WASM agent from the npm package with no framework, bundler, or install step. |
| [React + Vite Worker](examples/react-vite/README.md) | A browser Worker owns one persistent session and React consumes ordered events without reshaping the contract. |
| [Cloudflare managed agents + Multiplayer](js/managed/README.md) | Signed room objects add ordered N-human chat, bounded replay, a tool-free host-owned agent, and a global durable spend/allocation quota; provider credentials stay behind a private broker binding. |
| [Cloudflare credential broker](js/egress/README.md) | Two ordinary Workers use a private Service Binding for exact API-key or OAuth replacement and a singleton rotating Codex OAuth broker. |
| [Cloudflare X API](js/x-api/README.md) | First-party public X conversion and browsing Worker, exposed to agents as `browseX` and advertised by `accountInfo`. Deploy with `pnpm deploy:x` before managed agents. |
| [Cloudflare fetch + MCP](examples/cloudflare-fetch-mcp/README.md) | CSP-safe QuickJS Code Mode, deferred remote MCP, and caller-owned paid transport inside a serialized Durable Object. |
| [Rivet Actor](examples/rivet-actors/README.md) | Durable SQLite snapshots and idempotent turns around the WASM driver, with an actor-owned AgentOS workspace and previews. |
| [Vercel Workflow actor](examples/vercel-workflows/README.md) | A Rust-owned journal between stateless steps, replayable multi-client streams rendered through a replaceable wterm agent UI, and a persistent caller-owned Vercel Sandbox with a separate ephemeral wterm operator shell. |
| [exe.dev](examples/exe-dev/README.md) | Both a retained native session inside a VM and the inverse: a host agent controlling one exact remote VM through narrow tools. |
| [Python](examples/python) and [Node](examples/node/README.md) | Thin language bindings over the same results, events, history, snapshots, branches, and shutdown semantics. |

These are reference consumers, not portability promises. Cloudflare, Rivet,
Vercel, exe.dev, and the native VM layer each keep their platform policy above
the stable crates.

External products built on the published crates include
[popcorn-nanocodex](https://github.com/sriharshakaramchati/popcorn-nanocodex),
which drives a rented [Popcorn](https://popcorn.reclaimprotocol.org) TEE
browser session from a Nanocodex agent over CDP.

## What is stable

“Experimental” describes API stability. Only computer and evaluation APIs retain
that label. Computer is published for the supported VM integration; evaluation
crates remain unpublished. Browser, VM, and egress are supported source packages
while their pinned native/proxy dependencies are unavailable from crates.io.

## Design boundaries

Each provider-native runtime is intentionally narrow:

- OpenAI Responses and Claude Messages keep distinct transports and histories;
- shared owned lifecycle contracts, with provider-native typed state;
- caller-defined tools and application-owned policy;
- no provider/model portability layer;
- no generic JSON-RPC agent daemon or app-server protocol;
- no approval subsystem or compatibility framework; and
- no stable generic scheduler hidden inside the core agent.

The separation is what makes the SDK embeddable. Lower provider clients work
without the agent. Provider tools work without the CLI. Subagents compose above the
agent. VMs, browsers, voice, payment, durable actors, and evaluation remain
consumers with explicit owners.

The provider tool crates are real implementations, not aliases of a shared
provider runtime: `nanocodex-oai-tools` owns the OpenAI surface and
`nanocodex-claude-tools` owns Claude-native adapters. The latter has no OpenAI
or agent dependency, even with every feature enabled. Hosts provide permissions,
MCP transport and effect lifecycles explicitly. `nanocodex/oai-tools` and
`nanocodex/claude-tools` select the corresponding facade surface; the existing
facade `tools` feature remains an OpenAI compatibility alias. The npm package
`nanocodex-tools` keeps its name and is not part of this Rust crate rename.
